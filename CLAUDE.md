# Claude Code Configuration for PICARD

This file contains configuration and workflow information for working with Claude Code on the PICARD project.

## Git Practices

### Commit Messages
All commits should follow this format:
```
Brief summary of changes (50 chars or less)

Optional detailed description explaining:
- What was changed
- Why it was changed  
- Any important implementation details

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### Co-Authorship
Always include Claude as co-author on commits when working collaboratively:
```
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

## Preferred Workflow

### Development Cycle
We follow a **small, frequent commits** approach:

1. **Small Code Changes** 
   - Focus on single features or fixes
   - Keep changes manageable and reviewable
   - Prefer multiple small commits over giant commits

2. **Commit + Push** (ALWAYS BOTH)
   - Commit after **every todo item** (or at most every 2 items if very small)
   - **MANDATORY**: Push to remote immediately after every commit - never leave commits unpushed
   - Use descriptive commit messages
   - Never batch multiple major features into one commit
   - **CRITICAL**: Always `git push` after `git commit` - no exceptions

3. **Test**
   - **ALWAYS activate virtual environment first**: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - **MANDATORY**: Run tests after ANY code work (new code, edits, refactoring)
   - Run relevant tests after each commit
   - Ensure no regressions introduced
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - **Verify project status**: Always check that existing functionality still works

### Benefits of This Approach
- **Reduced Risk**: Smaller changes are easier to debug and revert
- **Better Collaboration**: Clear, focused commits improve code review
- **Faster Feedback**: Quick iterations catch issues early
- **Maintainable History**: Clean git history aids debugging and understanding
- **Reduced Merge Conflicts**: Frequent pushes minimize integration issues

## Commands for Quick Reference

### Standard Development Flow
```bash
# Make small, focused changes to code
# ...

# ALWAYS TEST AFTER CODE CHANGES
source venv/bin/activate && pytest

# Stage and commit changes
git add <files>
git commit -m "Brief description

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push to remote IMMEDIATELY (never skip this step)
git push

# Run tests again after commit (verification)
source venv/bin/activate && pytest
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Always activate venv first
source venv/bin/activate

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_file_generators.py

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src

# Run only fast tests
pytest -m "not slow"

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v
```

## File Organization for Claude Code

### Key Directories
- `src/` - Production code
- `tests/` - Test code (pytest-based)
- `PLANS/` - Planning documents and roadmaps
- `config/` - Configuration files and templates
- `results/` - Test run results and analysis

### Files Claude Should Know About
- `picard_config.py` - Main configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies  
- `src/file_generators.py` - File generation infrastructure
- `src/template_functions.py` - Template processing functions
- `src/scorer.py` - Scoring and evaluation logic

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Include docstrings for new functions and classes
- Handle errors gracefully with meaningful messages
- Use type hints where beneficial

### Testing Philosophy
- **Testing is non-negotiable**: ALWAYS run tests after ANY code changes
- Write tests for new functionality
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Prefer deterministic tests over probabilistic ones
- Use fixtures for reusable test data
- **Test early, test often**: Catch issues immediately, not later
- **All tests must pass**: Never commit with failing tests

### Documentation
- Update relevant documentation when making changes
- Keep README.md current with new features
- Document breaking changes clearly
- Maintain this CLAUDE.md file as workflow evolves
