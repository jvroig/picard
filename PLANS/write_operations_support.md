# Write Operations Support for PICARD - Discussion and Analysis

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Date**: August 26, 2025  
**Status**: Research and analysis phase  
**Priority**: TBD - needs concrete use cases

Currently, PICARD excels at testing **read/analysis operations** (aggregations, queries, data retrieval) but lacks capabilities to test **write/mutation operations** (updates, inserts, deletes, configuration changes). This document explores whether this gap is significant and how it might be addressed.

## 📊 Current PICARD Capabilities (Read-Only)

### What PICARD Tests Well
- **Analysis scenarios**: `csv_sum`, `json_path`, `sqlite_query` → "What is the total sales?"
- **Retrieval scenarios**: `file_line_count`, `yaml_value` → "What does this config contain?"  
- **Deterministic scoring**: "Does the output match expected value X?"
- **Anti-memorization**: Randomized data prevents training data contamination

### The Identified Gap
PICARD cannot currently test scenarios like:
- **Database mutations**: "Update all records where tag='update_me' to set status='completed'"
- **File modifications**: "Change all CSV rows where department='Sales' to set commission=0.15"  
- **Configuration updates**: "Update YAML config so logging.level=DEBUG and database.pool_size=20"
- **Data transformations**: "Add a new field 'processed_date' to all JSON objects in the array"

## 🤔 The Core Challenge: Verification Complexity

Traditional PICARD scoring verifies: **"What is the value at location X?"**

Write operations require verifying: **"Did the mutation happen correctly AND safely?"**

### Two-Part Verification Problem
1. **Target changes happened correctly** (records with tag='update_me' have correct new values)
2. **Non-target data remained unchanged** (all OTHER fields/records are exactly as they were)

This is fundamentally different from point-query verification and requires new approaches.

## 💡 Initial Solution Explorations

### Approach 1: Snapshot-Based Verification
```yaml
scoring_type: "data_mutation_verification" 
mutation_spec:
  target_changes:
    - where: "tag='update_me'"
      set: "status='completed'"
  verify_unchanged: 
    - exclude_fields: ["status", "last_modified"]
    - exclude_where: "tag='update_me'"
```

**Concept**: Take before/after snapshots, verify only intended changes occurred.

### Approach 2: Checksum Validation (Files Only)
```yaml
scoring_type: "selective_checksum"
checksum_excludes: ["status", "last_modified"]  # Fields allowed to change
target_verification: "{{csv_value_where:status:tag:update_me}}"
```

**Concept**: Checksum normalized file content excluding changed fields.

**Key insight**: Works for files (CSV, JSON, YAML, XML) after normalization (remove whitespace, sort keys) but **not for databases** due to row ordering, auto-generated fields, etc.

### Approach 3: Database-Specific Diff Logic
```yaml
scoring_type: "database_diff_verification"
target_changes:
  - table: "users"
    where: "tag='update_me'" 
    expected_changes: {"status": "completed"}
unchanged_verification:
  - table: "users"
    exclude_where: "tag='update_me'"
    exclude_fields: ["last_modified"]
    method: "row_count_and_sample_check"
```

## 🧠 Critical Insight: LLM Value Proposition Analysis

### Fundamental Question Asked
**"Are LLMs primarily for injecting human judgment into processes? Isn't that why analysis/read tasks are paramount?"**

This led to examining whether write operations are actually valuable for testing agentic AI capabilities.

### Value Analysis: Tool Selection vs. Execution Verification

**HIGH VALUE: Tool Selection Intelligence**
- Does the LLM understand the scenario and choose the right approach?
- Can the LLM identify that "customer billing complaint" requires `get_customer_billing_history()` then `update_account_status()`?
- Can the LLM extract correct parameters (customer_id, status flags, etc.)?

**LOWER VALUE: Execution Verification**  
- Did the database UPDATE actually change the right rows?
- This tests infrastructure reliability, not LLM capability

### Proposed Refocus: API Call Verification
```yaml
- question_id: 501
  template: "Customer {{semantic1:person_name}} reports billing discrepancy on account {{number1:1000:9999}}"
  scoring_type: "api_call_verification"
  expected_calls:
    - function: "get_customer_billing_history" 
      params: {"customer_id": "{{number1:1000:9999}}"}
    - function: "update_account_status"
      params: {"customer_id": "{{number1:1000:9999}}", "status": "billing_review"}
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation: Mock Tool System

### Architecture Concept
```python
# LLM sees realistic tool descriptions
def update_customer_status(customer_id: str, status: str, reason: str):
    """Update customer account status in the billing system."""
    
    # Implementation logs calls instead of executing
    call_log = {
        "function": "update_customer_status",
        "params": {"customer_id": customer_id, "status": status, "reason": reason},
        "timestamp": datetime.now(),
        "success": True  # Always "succeeds" for the LLM
    }
    write_to_call_log(call_log)
    return {"status": "success", "message": f"Updated customer {customer_id}"}
```

### Sandbox Integration
```yaml
sandbox_setup:
  mock_tools:
    - type: "customer_management_api"
      functions: ["get_customer_info", "update_customer_status", "get_billing_history"]
    - type: "inventory_system"  
      functions: ["check_stock", "reserve_item", "update_inventory"]
```

**Benefits**: 
- Tests LLM reasoning and tool selection
- No complex infrastructure verification needed
- Maintains PICARD's deterministic scoring approach

## 🔥 CRITICAL ASSESSMENT AND PIVOT

### Brutal Honest Analysis

**The discussion above represents exploring a solution to a potentially non-existent problem.**

### Major Issues Identified

**1. We're solving the wrong problem**
- PICARD already tests agentic AI effectively with read operations
- No concrete evidence provided that write operation testing is important
- Spent significant effort designing elaborate solutions without proving the need

**2. Mock tools approach is fundamentally flawed**
- Real agentic AI systems use REAL tools (file systems, databases, APIs)
- Mock tools test nothing meaningful - any LLM can call fake functions  
- Creates a "simulation of a simulation" divorced from reality

**3. Abandons PICARD's core strength**
- PICARD's competitive advantage is **anti-memorization through data randomization**
- Function call verification doesn't benefit from randomization
- This direction moves away from proven value proposition

**4. Questionable business case**
- Who needs to test "did LLM call update_customer_status() with right params"?
- This tests **API knowledge**, not **reasoning capability**
- Easily gamed by training on API documentation

### The Hard Questions

**Unanswered fundamental questions:**
- What actual problem are we trying to solve?
- Who are the users that need write operation testing?
- How is this better than existing integration testing approaches?
- Does this create meaningful differentiation for PICARD?

### Root Cause Analysis

**Pattern identified**: Started with clever technical observation (gap in write operations) but:
- Never established that filling this gap creates real value
- Engineered backward from solution rather than forward from problem
- Got caught up in technical complexity instead of user value

## 💡 CONCRETE USE CASES IDENTIFIED

### Cross-Format Write Operations - The Complete Picture

**Write operations are needed across ALL PICARD-supported formats**, not just databases:

### Database Admin Assistant - Oracle DBA AI Agent
**Scenario**: Agentic AI system that assists database administrators with complex Oracle database operations.

**Critical Tasks**:
- **Data Cleanup**: "Find and correct all customer records where email format is invalid"
- **Corruption Repair**: "Identify and fix referential integrity violations in the orders table"
- **Performance Optimization**: "Archive old audit records (>2 years) to improve query performance"
- **Security Remediation**: "Update all user accounts with weak passwords to require reset"
- **Data Migration**: "Migrate customer data from legacy format to new schema"

### JSON Configuration Management
**Scenario**: DevOps AI agent managing microservice configurations.

**Critical Tasks**:
- **Config Updates**: "Set all microservice configs to use new Redis endpoint"
- **Data Enrichment**: "Add 'processed_timestamp' field to all user records" 
- **Compliance**: "Remove PII fields from all objects where user_consent=false"
- **Schema Migration**: "Convert all API responses to use new authentication format"

### CSV Business Data Operations
**Scenario**: Business intelligence AI agent correcting and updating business data.

**Critical Tasks**:
- **Data Correction**: "Fix all rows where phone numbers have invalid formats"
- **Business Rules**: "Update commission rates for all Sales reps hired after 2023"
- **Data Migration**: "Convert all currency fields from EUR to USD using exchange rate 1.1"
- **Compliance Updates**: "Remove salary data for all terminated employees"

### XML Enterprise Integration
**Scenario**: Integration AI agent managing enterprise XML configurations and data.

**Critical Tasks**:
- **Configuration Management**: "Update all service endpoints from HTTP to HTTPS"
- **Schema Migration**: "Add new <metadata> section to all customer records"
- **Compliance**: "Remove deprecated <legacy_field> elements from all documents"
- **Data Standardization**: "Convert all date formats to ISO 8601 across XML feeds"

**Why This Matters for PICARD**:
- **High-stakes environments**: Configuration/data errors have major business impact across all formats
- **Complex reasoning required**: Must understand data relationships, business rules, impact analysis  
- **Tool selection critical**: Must choose right operations, safety procedures, rollback strategies
- **Parameter precision essential**: Wrong selectors could corrupt entire datasets
- **Cross-format consistency**: Same principles apply whether targeting JSON paths, CSV columns, or SQL WHERE clauses

**What We'd Test Across All Formats**:
- Does LLM correctly identify target data patterns?
- Does it choose appropriate modification strategy (update vs replace vs delete)?
- Does it extract correct parameters (selectors, new values, conditions)?
- Does it follow proper safety protocols (backup, validation, rollback)?
- Does it preserve non-target data integrity?

This represents **genuine agentic AI capability testing across all data formats** - not just API knowledge.

## 🏗️ UNIFIED TECHNICAL APPROACH

### Two-Phase Verification Architecture

**Core Principle**: Separate "target changes" from "preservation verification" across all formats.

```yaml
scoring_type: "targeted_edit_verification"
phases:
  1: "edit_correctness"     # Did target changes happen correctly?
  2: "preservation_check"   # Did non-target data remain unchanged?

edit_spec:
  target_selector: "$.users[?(@.department == 'Sales')]"  # JSONPath/XPath/SQL WHERE clause
  target_changes: {"commission_rate": 0.15}
  
preservation_spec:
  exclude_paths: ["$.users[*].commission_rate", "$.users[*].last_updated"]
  method: "normalized_checksum"  # For files; custom logic for databases
```

### Format-Specific Implementations

#### Files (JSON/CSV/XML/YAML)
```python
def verify_targeted_file_edit(original_file, modified_file, edit_spec):
    # 1. Verify target changes occurred correctly
    target_changes_correct = verify_targets(modified_file, edit_spec.targets)
    
    # 2. Verify preservation using normalized diff
    original_normalized = normalize_excluding_paths(original_file, edit_spec.exclude_paths)
    modified_normalized = normalize_excluding_paths(modified_file, edit_spec.exclude_paths) 
    
    preservation_correct = (original_normalized == modified_normalized)
    
    return target_changes_correct and preservation_correct

def normalize_excluding_paths(file_path, exclude_paths):
    """Normalize file format (remove whitespace, sort keys) excluding specified paths"""
    if file_type == "json":
        data = json.load(file_path)
        remove_paths(data, exclude_paths)  # Remove excluded paths
        return json.dumps(data, sort_keys=True, separators=(',', ':'))
    elif file_type == "csv":
        # Standardize delimiters, sort by primary key, exclude specified columns
        # ... implementation details
```

#### Databases (SQLite/PostgreSQL/etc.)
```python
def verify_targeted_db_edit(table, edit_spec):
    # 1. Verify target changes with SQL
    target_check = execute_sql(
        f"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM {table} WHERE {edit_spec.where_clause} AND {edit_spec.expected_state}"
    )
    
    # 2. Verify preservation with row checksums (excluding changed columns)
    exclude_columns = ', '.join(edit_spec.exclude_columns)
    unchanged_columns = get_columns_excluding(table, edit_spec.exclude_columns)
    
    unchanged_rows_checksum = execute_sql(
        f"SELECT MD5(GROUP_CONCAT({unchanged_columns} ORDER BY id)) FROM {table} WHERE NOT ({edit_spec.where_clause})"
    )
    
    return target_check == expected_count and unchanged_rows_checksum == original_checksum
```

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: JSON Only (Simplest Format)
- Implement JSONPath-based target selection
- Create JSON normalization with path exclusions
- Build foundation for other formats

#### Phase 2: CSV Extension  
- Column-based target selection
- CSV normalization with column exclusions
- Handle row ordering variations

#### Phase 3: XML/YAML Support
- XPath and YAML path support
- Format-specific normalization
- Schema-aware exclusions

#### Phase 4: Database Integration
- SQL WHERE clause target selection
- Row-level and column-level checksums
- Multi-table operation support

### Database Write Scenario Modeling

```yaml
# Example: Realistic database corruption and repair scenario
sandbox_setup:
  components:
    - type: "create_sqlite"
      target_file: "{{artifacts}}/{{qs_id}}/customer_db.sqlite"
      content:
        tables:
          customers:
            schema: "id INTEGER, name TEXT, email TEXT, status TEXT, last_updated DATETIME"
            rows: 100
            corruption_scenarios:
              - invalid_emails: 15%      # Inject 15% invalid email formats
              - duplicate_ids: 5%        # Create 5% duplicate ID conflicts
              - null_statuses: 10%       # 10% missing status values
              - inconsistent_dates: 8%   # Date format inconsistencies

question_template: "Fix all customer records where email format is invalid in the database at {{artifacts}}/{{qs_id}}/customer_db.sqlite"

scoring_type: "database_targeted_edit"
target_verification: 
  - query: "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE email NOT LIKE '%@%.%'"
    expected: 0  # All invalid emails should be fixed
    
preservation_verification:
  exclude_columns: ["email", "last_updated"]
  method: "row_checksum"
  query: "SELECT MD5(GROUP_CONCAT(id || '|' || name || '|' || status ORDER BY id)) FROM customers"
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Normalize Before Compare**: Strip whitespace, sort keys, standardize formatting
2. **Path-Based Exclusions**: Exclude fields that should change (timestamps, target fields)
3. **Deterministic Scenarios**: Use PICARD's variable system for predictable test data
4. **Safety First**: Always backup original data in sandbox environment
5. **Format Agnostic**: Same verification logic works across JSON, CSV, XML, databases

This unified approach could become **PICARD's killer feature** - no other testing framework combines anti-memorization with sophisticated cross-format write operation verification.
