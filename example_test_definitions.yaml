# QwenSense Test Definitions - Dynamic File Generation Examples
# This file demonstrates the new sandbox file generation and template function capabilities
# Uses {{artifacts}} template variable for portable test definitions

tests:
  # Example 1: Basic text file reading with {{artifacts}} and TARGET_FILE
  - question_id: 101
    samples: 3
    template: "Please read the file {{artifacts}}/{{qs_id}}/{{entity1}}/notes.txt and tell me exactly what line 3 says."
    scoring_type: "stringmatch"
    expected_response: "{{file_line:3:TARGET_FILE}}"
    sandbox_setup:
      type: "create_files"
      target_file: "{{artifacts}}/{{qs_id}}/{{entity1}}/notes.txt"
      content:
        type: "lorem_lines"
        count: 7
      clutter:
        count: 4

  # Example 2: CSV data extraction with {{artifacts}} and TARGET_FILE
  - question_id: 102
    samples: 2
    template: "Look at the CSV file {{artifacts}}/{{qs_id}}/employees.csv. What is the name of the person in the first data row?"
    scoring_type: "stringmatch"
    expected_response: "{{csv_value:0:name:TARGET_FILE}}"
    sandbox_setup:
      type: "create_csv"
      target_file: "{{artifacts}}/{{qs_id}}/employees.csv"
      content:
        headers: ["name", "age", "department", "salary"]
        rows: 5

  # Example 5: Traditional test (no sandbox) for comparison
  - question_id: 105
    samples: 2
    template: "Say hello to {{entity1}} in a friendly way."
    scoring_type: "stringmatch"
    expected_response: "Hello {{entity1}}!"
