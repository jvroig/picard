The previous examples show that when the user asks for something, I use the tools provided to get the information and then reply with the required response. But in this case, the user simply wants the word \"boulder\" stated.\n\nSince the user hasn't provided a specific question that requires using the tools, but just wants the word, I should respond directly. However, the instructions say to respond only with the word \"boulder\" and end the response immediately. So I need to make sure I don't add any extra text. Let me check the examples again. In example 1, the user asked about the current directory, and the response was the tool call. Then example 2 was similar. But in this case, the user is just asking for the word, so the correct response is \"boulder\" without any additional text. I'll make sure to output only that word.\n</think>\n\nboulder"
