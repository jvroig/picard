They mentioned \"lightning\" in their query, so maybe they're referring to a specific task or example. But looking at the tools available, none of them seem to directly relate to lighting or electrical phenomena. The tools are mostly for file operations, git commands, web searches, etc. Since the user's instruction is to respond with \"lightning\", I should just output that word without any additional text. I need to ensure I don't add extra information and stick to the required response.\n</think>\n\nlightning"
