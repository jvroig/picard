The tools are all related to file systems, git, web search, Python, SQLite, etc. None of them seem to handle generating random words or any text output except for the specific tools like get_cwd or list_directory. Since the user's request is to output those three words, and there's no tool that directly does that, I need to respond directly without using any tools. The instructions say to respond only with the three words in order, so I'll just output them.\n</think>\n\ntiger golden chaos"
