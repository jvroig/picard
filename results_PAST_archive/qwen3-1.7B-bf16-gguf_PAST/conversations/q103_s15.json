The tools include things like file operations, git commands, web search, etc. But none of the tools seem to generate random words or respond with specific phrases. The user might be testing if I can handle unexpected requests or maybe they want a creative response. Since the tools don't support generating random words, I should just output the exact words they asked for. No need to use any tools here. Let me make sure I don't add extra text. Just the three words in order.\n</think>\n\nterminal mountain amber"
