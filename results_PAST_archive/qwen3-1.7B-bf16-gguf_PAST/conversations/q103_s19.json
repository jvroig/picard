They just want me to output those three words in order.\n\nI need to make sure I don't add any extra text. The instructions say to respond only with those three words. Since there's no tool needed here, I just have to output them exactly as specified. No tool calls are required because the task is simple and doesn't involve any of the available tools. So, the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nwonder scanner heavy"
