The tools include things like file operations, git commands, web search, etc. But the user's request is about a network lightning sketch. Hmm, I don't see a tool directly related to creating or generating a network lightning sketch. The available tools are for system operations, git, web search, Python execution, SQLite, etc. Since there's no tool for generating art or sketches, I should inform the user that I can't perform that task with the current tools. So the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nnetwork lightning sketch"
