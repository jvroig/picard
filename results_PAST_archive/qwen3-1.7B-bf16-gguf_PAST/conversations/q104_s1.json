      "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to create a specific directory structure inside /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, the structure includes two main directories: white and wonder. The white directory has subdirectories bear and logs, with logs containing blue.log. The wonder directory has a README.md.\n\nI need to use the create_directory tool for each level. Starting with the white directory. The path would be /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/white. Then, inside white, create bear and logs. For logs, create blue.log in the logs directory.\n\nWait, the user specified that the white directory is inside the sandbox folder. So first, create white. Then, inside white, create bear and logs. Then, inside logs, create blue.log. Then, create wonder and its README.md.\n\nI should call create_directory for each step. Let me check the parameters. The create_directory tool requires the path. So first, create /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/white. Then, /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/white/bear, then /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/white/logs, then /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/white/logs/blue.log. Then, /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/wonder and /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/wonder/README.md.\n\nEach creation needs to be done sequentially. I need to make sure each directory is created properly. The user might not have the directories yet, so each create_directory call will handle one level at a time. Once all are created, the structure should be complete.\n</think>\n\n[[qwen-tool-start]]\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"create_directory\",\n    \"input\": {\n        \"path\": \"/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/white\"\n    }\n}\n```\n[[qwen-tool-end"

After that, create the wonder directory and its README.md.\n\nI'll call create_directory for each step. Start with white, then bear, logs, blue.log, wonder, and README.md.
