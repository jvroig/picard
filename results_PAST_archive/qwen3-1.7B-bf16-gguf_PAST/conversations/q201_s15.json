I need to specify the path, show_line_numbers, start_line, and end_line. Since they only want line 34, I'll set start_line to 34 and end_line to 34. The show_line_numbers can be false to avoid extra lines. Then, I'll parse the response to extract the exact content of line 34. If the file doesn't exist or there's an error, I'll inform the user, but assuming it works, I'll just provide the line.\n</think>\n\n[[qwen-tool-start]]\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"read_file\",\n    \"input\": {\n        \"path\": \"/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q201_s15/rustic/notes.txt\",\n        \"show_line_numbers\": false,\n        \"start_line\": 34,\n        \"end_line\": 34\n    }\n}\n```\n[[qwen-tool-end"
