      "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to create a JSON summary of a CSV file and then save it to a specific location. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s12/outline/crm_export.csv. The user wants the total number of customers and the average age. So, I'll use the read_file tool to read the CSV. I'll set the path to the file and maybe specify parameters like show_line_numbers or show_repr, but since the user didn't mention those, I'll default to the standard settings.\n\nOnce I have the data, I need to process it to extract the total customers and average age. That means counting the number of rows (assuming each row is a customer) and calculating the average of the age column. But I need to make sure the data is correctly parsed. If the CSV has headers, I'll need to check that.\n\nAfter processing, I'll create a JSON object with \"total_customers\" and \"average_age\". Then, I need to write this JSON to a file at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s12/cust.json. For that, I'll use the write_file tool, passing the path and the JSON content.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned creating the JSON with those two keys. I should make sure that the JSON structure is correct. Also, I need to handle any potential errors, like if the CSV isn't readable or if the data isn't in the expected format. However, since the user is asking for a summary, I'll proceed under the assumption that the data is available and correctly formatted.\n\nSo the steps are: read the CSV, process the data, create the JSON, and write it to the specified file. I'll use the read_file tool first, then process the data, then write it with write_file. But since the user wants the JSON summary, I need to ensure that the processing steps are correctly implemented. However, the tools available don't include a data processing tool, so I'll have to handle that within the read_file's output. Once the data is read, I can parse it, count the rows, and calculate the average age.\n\nI should also check if the CSV has a header row. If it does, I'll exclude it when counting the customers. For the average age, I'll sum the ages and divide by the number of customers. But I need to make sure that the data is correctly parsed. If the CSV has a column named 'age', that's the one to use. If not, maybe the user expects a specific column name, but since the user didn't specify, I'll assume the correct column.\n\nOnce the data is processed, the JSON will be created and written to the file. The final answer will be the JSON content in the file, so I'll use the write_file tool with the appropriate parameters.\n</think>\n\n[[qwen-tool-start]]\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"read_file\",\n    \"input\": {\n        \"path\": \"/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s12/outline/crm_export.csv\",\n        \"show_line_numbers\": false,\n        \"start_line\": 1,\n        \"end_line\": 1000\n    }\n}\n```\n[[qwen-tool-end"
