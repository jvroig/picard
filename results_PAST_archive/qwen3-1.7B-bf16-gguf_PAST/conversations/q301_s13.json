Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s13/scanner/crm_export.csv. The user wants the total number of customers and the average age. So, I'll use the read_file tool to read the CSV. I'll set show_line_numbers to False and maybe show_repr to True to get the data correctly.\n\nOnce I have the data, I need to process it. The CSV probably has columns like 'customer_id' and 'age'. I'll need to count the number of rows to get total customers. Then calculate the average age by summing all ages and dividing by the count.\n\nAfter processing, I'll create a JSON object with 'total_customers' and 'average_age'. Then, I'll write this JSON to /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s13/cust.json using the write_file tool. I should make sure the file path is correct and the content is properly formatted.\n\nWait, the user mentioned creating the JSON file. I need to check if the CSV has the necessary data. If there's an error in reading the CSV, like if the file doesn't exist or isn't readable, I should handle that. But assuming the file is accessible, proceed.\n\nSo the steps are: read the CSV, process the data, create the JSON, and write it. Use the read_file tool first, then process the data, then write the JSON. I'll need to use the read_file tool with the correct parameters, then use the write_file tool with the processed data.\n</think>\n\n[[qwen-tool-start]]\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"read_file\",\n    \"input\": {\n        \"path\": \"/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s13/scanner/crm_export.csv\",\n        \"show_line_numbers\": false,\n        \"start_line\": 1,\n        \"end_line\": null,\n        \"show_repr\": true\n    }\n}\n```\n[[qwen-tool-end"
