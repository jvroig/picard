      "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to create a JSON summary of a CSV file and then save it to a specific JSON file. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s16/chaos/crm_export.csv. The user wants the total number of customers and the average age. So, I'll use the read_file tool to read the CSV. I'll set show_line_numbers to False and maybe show_repr to True to get the data properly.\n\nOnce I have the data, I need to process it. The CSV probably has columns like 'customer_id' and 'age'. I'll need to count the number of rows to get total customers. Then calculate the average age by summing all ages and dividing by the count.\n\nAfter processing, I'll create a JSON object with 'total_customers' and 'average_age'. Then, I'll write this JSON to /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s16/cust.json using the write_file tool.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned creating the JSON file. So first, I need to read the CSV, process the data, then write the JSON. Let me check if the read_file tool can handle the CSV. The read_file tool's parameters include path, and the example uses a file path. So I'll call read_file with the path to the CSV.\n\nOnce the data is read, I'll need to parse it. Assuming the CSV has headers, I'll extract the columns. Then count the rows and calculate the average. Then write the JSON.\n\nI should also handle any potential errors, like if the CSV is empty or if there's no age column. But the user didn't mention handling errors, so maybe proceed as per the instructions.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Use read_file to get the CSV data.\n2. Process the data to find total customers and average age.\n3. Use write_file to save the JSON with those values.\n\nI need to make sure the JSON is correctly formatted. The user wants the JSON to have 'total_customers' and 'average_age' keys. So the JSON should be a dictionary with those keys.\n\nNow, I'll call the tools step by step. First, read the CSV, then process the data, then write the JSON.\n</think>\n\n[[qwen-tool-start]]\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"read_file\",\n    \"input\": {\n        \"path\": \"/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s16/chaos/crm_export.csv\",\n        \"show_repr\": true\n    }\n}\n```\n[[qwen-tool-end"
