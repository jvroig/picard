The user wants a JSON summary of a CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s2/beach/crm_export.csv, specifically showing the total number of customers and the average age. Then, they need to create a JSON file called cust.json with those two values.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file to extract the data. The user mentioned using the read_file tool. So I'll use read_file with the path to the CSV. But wait, the parameters for read_file include show_line_numbers, start_line, end_line, and show_repr. However, the user didn't specify any particular lines or formatting, so maybe I can just read the entire file. The tool will return the contents, which I can then process.\n\nOnce I have the CSV data, I need to calculate the total customers and average age. The CSV probably has columns like 'customer_id' and 'age'. Assuming the CSV has a 'customer_id' column for each customer, the total customers would be the count of unique customer IDs. But if there are duplicates, I need to count each customer once. However, the user didn't specify how the data is structured, so I'll have to make assumptions. Maybe the CSV has a 'customer_id' column, and each row represents a customer. So total_customers would be the number of rows, and average_age would be the average of the 'age' column.\n\nBut wait, the user might have the data in a specific format. Since I can't see the actual data, I'll have to proceed with the assumption that the CSV has a 'customer_id' column and an 'age' column. So, I'll read the CSV, count the number of rows (total_customers), and calculate the average of the 'age' column.\n\nAfter processing the data, I need to create a JSON object with 'total_customers' and 'average_age'. Then, write that JSON to a file named cust.json.\n\nBut first, I need to read the CSV. Let's call the read_file tool with the path to the CSV. The parameters would be path: \"/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s2/beach/crm_export.csv\". The tool will return the contents. Then, I'll parse that data to extract the necessary numbers.\n\nOnce I have the data, I can calculate the total customers as the count of rows, and average age as the mean of the 'age' column. Then, write that into the JSON file using the write_file tool.\n\nWait, but the user might have the data in a different format. For example, maybe the CSV has a 'customer_id' column, and each row is a customer. So total_customers is the number of rows, and average_age is the average of the 'age' column.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Use read_file to get the CSV content.\n2. Parse the CSV data to count the number of rows (total_customers).\n3. Calculate the average age from the 'age' column.\n4. Create a JSON object with these two values.\n5. Use write_file to save the JSON to cust.json.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the CSV is properly read. The read_file tool's parameters include show_line_numbers, start_line, end_line, and show_repr. Since the user didn't specify any of these, I'll default to reading the entire file. The tool will return the contents, which I can then process.\n\nOnce the data is read, I need to process it. Let's assume the CSV has headers. So the first row is the header, and the rest are the data. The total_customers would be the number of rows after the header. The average age would be the average of the 'age' column.\n\nSo, in code terms, after reading the CSV, I can split the data into rows, count the number of rows, and calculate the average.\n\nBut since I can't execute code here, I have to simulate this process. The read_file tool will return the contents, which I can then parse.\n\nOnce the data is parsed, the JSON will be created with the two values.\n\nThen, the write_file tool will be used to write the JSON to the specified path.\n\nSo the steps in the tool calls would be:\n\n1. Call read_file with the path to the CSV.\n2. Process the returned data to get total_customers and average_age.\n3. Call write_file with the path to cust.json and the JSON content.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the JSON is correctly formatted. The JSON should have \"total_customers\" and \"average_age\" as keys.\n\nNow, the user might have the CSV with different columns, but based on the problem statement, I'll proceed with the assumption that the CSV has the necessary columns"
