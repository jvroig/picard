      "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a JSON summary of a CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s4/harmony/crm_export.csv, specifically showing the total number of customers and the average age. Then, they need to create a JSON file called cust.json with those two values.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file to extract the data. The user mentioned using the read_file tool. So I'll use read_file with the path to the CSV. But wait, the parameters for read_file include show_line_numbers, start_line, end_line, and show_repr. However, the user didn't specify any line numbers or formatting, so maybe I can just read the entire file without those parameters.\n\nOnce the CSV is read, I need to process the data. The CSV likely has columns like 'customer_id' and 'age'. The total customers would be the count of rows, and the average age would be the mean of the 'age' column. But I need to make sure the data is correctly parsed. If the CSV has headers, I should read the first row as the header and then process the rest.\n\nAfter parsing, I'll calculate the total customers as the number of rows and the average age by summing all ages and dividing by the number of customers. Then, I'll write this into a JSON file named cust.json with the two keys.\n\nBut wait, the user wants the JSON summary. So the summary should include the total customers and average age. The cust.json file should have those two values. So the steps are: read the CSV, process the data, calculate the required stats, then write them to the JSON file.\n\nI need to check if the CSV exists. If it's not there, the read_file tool might return an error. But assuming it's present, proceed. Then, use the write_file tool to create the JSON file with the calculated values.\n\nWait, the user said \"create /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s4/cust.json with the JSON containing total_customers and average_age\". So the JSON should have those two keys. The values are the calculated numbers.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Use read_file on the CSV path to get the data.\n2. Parse the data, count the rows (total customers), sum the ages, compute average age.\n3. Use write_file to create cust.json with the two values.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the CSV is read correctly. If the CSV has headers, the first row is the header, and the rest are data rows. So the total customers would be the number of rows after the header. The average age would be the mean of the 'age' column.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nRead the CSV, split into rows, count the rows, sum the ages, compute average.\n\nThen write the JSON with those values.\n\nBut I need to implement this using the available tools. The read_file tool can read the CSV, but I need to process the data. However, the read_file tool returns the contents of the file, which I can then parse.\n\nSo the steps in the tool calls would be:\n\nFirst, read the CSV file using read_file with the path. Then, process the data to get the total customers and average age. Then, write the JSON to the specified path.\n\nBut the user's request is to create the JSON, so the write_file tool is needed. However, the write_file tool requires the path and content. So I need to generate the JSON content based on the data.\n\nBut how to generate the JSON content? The user didn't provide the actual data, so I need to simulate that. Wait, but in the context of the tool calls, I can't actually process the data. The read_file tool would return the contents of the CSV, which I can then parse.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Call read_file on the CSV path to get the data.\n2. Parse the data to extract the total customers and average age.\n3. Call write_file with the path and the JSON content.\n\nBut the problem is that the read_file tool returns the contents of the file, which might be a string. So I need to parse that string into a structured format. However, the user's instructions don't mention parsing the CSV, so perhaps the read_file tool's output is the raw data, and I need to process it in the code.\n\nBut since I can't actually process the data here, I need to make the tool calls as per the available functions. So the first tool call is read_file with the path. Then, the next step would be to process the data, but since I can't do that here, maybe the answer is to call read_file and then write_file with the calculated values.\n\nWait, but the user wants the JSON"
