      "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to create a JSON summary of a CSV file and then save it to a specific JSON file. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s7/tower/crm_export.csv. The user wants the total number of customers and the average age. So, I'll use the read_file tool to read the CSV. I'll set show_line_numbers to False and maybe show_repr to True to get the data correctly.\n\nOnce I have the data, I need to process it. The CSV probably has columns like 'customer_id' and 'age'. I'll need to count the number of rows to get total_customers and calculate the average of the 'age' column. But wait, how do I handle the data? Maybe the CSV has a header row, so I'll need to skip that. Let's assume the first row is the header, and the rest are the data.\n\nAfter reading the data, I'll calculate total_customers as the number of rows. For average_age, I'll sum all the ages and divide by the number of customers. But I need to make sure that the data is correctly parsed. If the CSV has a column named 'age', that's the one to use.\n\nOnce I have the numbers, I'll create a JSON object with 'total_customers' and 'average_age'. Then, I need to write this JSON to a file at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s7/cust.json. For that, I'll use the write_file tool, specifying the path and the JSON content.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned creating the JSON file. So, I need to make sure that the JSON is properly formatted. Also, I should check if the CSV file exists and can be read. If there's an error, like the file not found, I need to handle that. But the user hasn't mentioned handling errors, so maybe proceed under the assumption that the file exists.\n\nSo, the steps are: read the CSV, process the data to get the totals, create the JSON, and write it to the specified path. Let me call the read_file tool first to get the data.\n</think>\n\n[[qwen-tool-start]]\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"read_file\",\n    \"input\": {\n        \"path\": \"/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s7/tower/crm_export.csv\",\n        \"show_line_numbers\": false,\n        \"start_line\": 1,\n        \"end_line\": null,\n        \"show_repr\": true\n    }\n}\n```\n[[qwen-tool-end"
