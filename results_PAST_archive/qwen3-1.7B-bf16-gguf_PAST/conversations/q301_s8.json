      "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a JSON summary of a CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s8/plaza/crm_export.csv, specifically showing the total number of customers and the average age. Then, they need to create a JSON file called cust.json with those two values.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file to extract the data. The user mentioned using the read_file tool, so I'll use that. The parameters would include the path to the CSV, and since they want the total customers and average age, I'll set show_line_numbers to False and maybe show_repr to False to get the data without line numbers or reprs. But wait, the read_file tool's parameters include show_line_numbers, start_line, end_line, show_repr. The user didn't specify lines, so maybe default settings are okay.\n\nOnce the CSV is read, I need to process the data. The total customers would be the count of rows, and average age would be the mean of the age column. But I need to make sure the CSV has columns for customer count and age. If the CSV has columns like 'customer_id' and 'age', then the total customers would be the count of rows, and average age would be sum of ages divided by count.\n\nBut the user didn't specify the structure of the CSV. So I need to read the CSV and check the columns. However, the read_file tool can return the contents, so I can process the data from there. Let's assume the CSV has columns 'customer_id' and 'age'. Then, the total customers is the number of rows, and average age is sum of ages divided by total customers.\n\nOnce I have those two values, I can create the cust.json file using the write_file tool. The content would be a JSON object with \"total_customers\" and \"average_age\".\n\nBut wait, the user wants the JSON summary of the CSV. So the JSON summary would include the total customers and average age. So the first step is to read the CSV, process the data, and then create the JSON.\n\nBut how to handle the CSV? Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, use read_file on the CSV path. Then, parse the data. For example, if the CSV has columns 'customer_id' and 'age', then the total customers is the number of rows, and average age is sum of 'age' column divided by total customers.\n\nBut the user might not have specified the exact structure, so I need to read the CSV and process it. However, the read_file tool's return value is the contents of the file, which could be a string. So I need to parse that string into a DataFrame or similar structure to extract the data.\n\nOnce the data is parsed, calculate the total customers and average age. Then, write that into cust.json.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Use read_file on the CSV path to get the contents.\n2. Parse the CSV data (maybe using pandas or another library, but since the tool doesn't have that, I need to process it manually).\n3. Calculate total customers and average age.\n4. Use write_file to create cust.json with the two values.\n\nBut the user's tools don't include a pandas library, so I need to process the CSV data manually. However, the read_file tool's return value is the contents of the file, which is a string. So I can split the string into lines and process each line.\n\nAssuming the CSV has headers, the first line is the header, and the rest are rows. For example:\n\ncustomer_id,age\n1,30\n2,25\n3,35\n\nThen, total customers is 3, average age is (30+25+35)/3 = 30.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead the CSV, count the number of rows (total customers), sum the 'age' column, divide by total customers for average age.\n\nBut how to do this with the tools available? The read_file tool returns the contents as a string. So I need to process that string.\n\nBut the user's tools don't have a way to parse the CSV, so I have to assume that the read_file returns the data in a format that can be parsed. For example, if the CSV is in the format:\n\ncustomer_id,age\n1,30\n2,25\n3,35\n\nThen, the first line is the header, and the rest are rows. So the total customers is the number of rows after the header.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead the CSV, split into lines, count the number of lines (excluding the header), then sum the 'age' column.\n\nBut since the user's tools don't have a way to process the CSV, I"
