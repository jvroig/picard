The user wants to find the number of orders above $50,000 from the Engineering department in the specified SQLite database and then save that number in a JSON file.\n\nFirst, I need to connect to the SQLite database at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q402_s10/summary.db. Using the sqlite_connect tool, I'll check if the connection is successful. If it is, I'll execute a query to count the orders where the department is 'Engineering' and the order amount is greater than 50000.\n\nThe query should select the count of rows where the department column matches 'Engineering' and the amount is > 50000. Once I get the result, I'll format it into a JSON object with the key 'num_big_orders' and save it to the specified file using the write_file tool.\n\nI need to make sure that the database path is correct and that the query is properly structured. If there are any errors during the connection or query execution, I'll handle them appropriately. Also, after getting the result, I'll verify that the JSON file is created successfully.\n</think>\n\n[[qwen-tool-start]]\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"sqlite_connect\",\n    \"input\": {\n        \"database_path\": \"/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q402_s10/summary.db\"\n    }\n}\n```\n[[qwen-tool-end"

The database tables are enterprise_customers, enterprise_orders, and sqlite_sequence. The user is asking about orders from the Engineering department, so the table must be enterprise_orders. The error suggests that 'department' isn't a column in that table. Maybe the column name is different, like 'department_name' or 'department_id'. Since the user mentioned the Engineering department, perhaps the column is named 'department' but with a different case, like 'Department' or 'department_id'. I'll try using 'department_id' again, but if that fails, maybe the column is named 'department_name'. Alternatively, maybe the table isn't enterprise_orders but something else.
