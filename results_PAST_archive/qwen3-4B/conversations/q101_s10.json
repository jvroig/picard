Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the directory exists. If it doesn't, maybe I should create it first. But the user didn't mention creating the directory, so perhaps it's already there. But to be safe, maybe I should verify that. Wait, the user's instruction is to create the files in that specific directory. So maybe the directory exists, or I need to create it if it doesn't. However, the tools available don't include a directory creation tool unless specified. Wait, the user said \"create these files\", so maybe the directory is already present. But if not, I might need to use the create_directory tool. But the user didn't mention that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user assumes the directory exists. Let me check the available tools. There's a create_directory tool. So perhaps I should first check if the directory exists. But the user's instruction is to create the files, not the directory. However, if the directory doesn't exist, creating the files would fail. So maybe I need to create the directory first. But the user didn't ask for that. Wait, the user's exact request is to create the files in that directory. So perhaps the directory is already there. But to be thorough, maybe I should check. However, the tools available don't include a way to check if a directory exists. Wait, the list_directory tool can list the contents of a directory. So maybe I can use that to check if the directory exists. But the user might not have permissions. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed to create the files, and if the directory doesn't exist, the write_file or create_directory tool would handle it. Wait, the create_directory tool is available. So perhaps the correct approach is to first create the directory if it doesn't exist, then create the files. But the user didn't mention creating the directory, so maybe they expect it to be there. However, to ensure that the files are created successfully, it's better to create the directory if necessary.\n\nWait, the user's instruction is to create the files in the specified directory. So maybe the directory is already present. But to be safe, perhaps I should first check if the directory exists. However, the list_directory tool can be used with the path. Let me think: if I call list_directory with the path /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/amber, it will list the contents. If the directory doesn't exist, it would return an error. But the user might not have permissions. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the directory exists. But since the user is asking to create the files there, perhaps the directory is supposed to be created as part of the process. But the user didn't mention that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is okay with the files being created in that directory regardless of whether it exists. But if the directory doesn't exist, creating the files would fail. So perhaps I should first create the directory using create_directory tool, then create the files. But the user didn't ask to create the directory.
