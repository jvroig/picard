They specified to respond only with those three words, each separated by a space. I need to check if there's any hidden requirement or if I should use any tools for this. But the query doesn't mention anything about using tools, just a straightforward response. The examples provided earlier show that when a tool is needed, the assistant calls it and then provides a summary. However, in this case, the user isn't asking for any action or information that requires a tool. They're just asking for a specific phrase. So I should just output the three words as instructed. No need to use any of the available tools here. Just a simple, direct response.\n</think>\n\ngentle river ocean"
