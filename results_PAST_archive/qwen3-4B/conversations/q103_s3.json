I need to check if there are any hidden rules or if there's a trick here. But the query seems straightforward. I'll just output the three words as instructed. No tools are needed for this, since it's a simple text response. I should ensure there's nothing else added accidentally. Yep, that's all.\n</think>\n\ndog note azure"
