The previous examples show that after tool calls, the assistant summarizes the results. But in this case, the user is asking for a specific response without any tool calls. So I should just output the three words as instructed. No need for any additional text or explanations. Let me confirm the exact wording: \"chamber summary protocol\" with each word separated and in order. Yes, that's correct. I'll proceed to send that response.\n</think>\n\nchamber summary protocol"
