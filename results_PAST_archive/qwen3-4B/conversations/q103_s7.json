They said to respond only with those three words, each separated by a space. I need to check if there's any specific formatting required. The example given in the problem shows that the assistant should immediately end the response after the tool call and the triple backticks. But in this case, the user isn't asking for a tool call; they're just requesting a specific phrase.\n\nWait, the user's message is a direct instruction to output those three words. The previous examples involved tool calls, but this one doesn't. So I should just output the exact phrase without any tool calls. Let me confirm that the response should be exactly \"compass framework journey\" with no additional text. The user emphasized \"only with these three words in the given order,\" so I must adhere strictly to that. No explanations, no extra characters. Just the three words separated by spaces. Alright, that's straightforward. I'll make sure there's nothing else added and that the spelling is correct.\n</think>\n\ncompass framework journey"
