Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s19/golden/crm_export.csv. The goal is to calculate the total number of customers and the average age from this data. Then, I have to create another JSON file at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s19/cust.json with these two values.\n\nBut wait, the tools available don't include a CSV reader. The tools are for file operations like read_file, write_file, etc. So I need to use the read_file tool to get the contents of the CSV. Once I have the data, I can process it to find the total customers and average age. However, the read_file tool might not handle CSVs directly, but maybe the user expects me to parse the CSV data from the text.\n\nAssuming that the CSV is in a format where each line represents a customer, with age in a specific column. Let's say the first row is headers, and the age is in a column named 'age' or similar. But without knowing the exact structure, I'll have to make assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the CSV is simple enough that I can split the lines and count entries.\n\nWait, the user might not have provided the actual data, so I need to use the read_file tool to get the content. Once I have the content, I can process it. But since I can't execute code here, I need to simulate that. However, the tools available don't include a CSV parser, so maybe the user expects me to use the read_file tool to get the data and then manually calculate the values. But that's not possible here. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the read_file tool to get the data, then process it in my mind.\n\nWait, the user is asking me to create a JSON summary. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the CSV file using read_file.\n2. Parse the data to count total customers and calculate average age.\n3. Write the results to the JSON file.\n\nBut since I can't actually process the CSV data here, maybe the user expects me to use the read_file tool to get the data, then use the write_file tool to create the JSON. However, without knowing the actual data, I can't compute the numbers. But the user might be expecting me to simulate this process.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is testing if I can use the tools correctly. So I need to call read_file on the CSV, then process the data (even though I can't do that here), then write the JSON. But since I can't process the data, perhaps the answer is to call the read_file and write_file tools, but the actual calculation would be done by the user's system.\n\nWait, the user is asking me to create the JSON file with the calculated values. So I need to first read the CSV, then compute the values, then write them. But since I can't process the CSV data here, maybe the answer is to use the read_file tool to get the data, then use the write_file tool to create the JSON with the calculated values. However, without knowing the data, I can't compute the numbers.
