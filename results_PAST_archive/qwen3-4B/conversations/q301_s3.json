Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s3/blue/crm_export.csv. The goal is to calculate two things: the total number of customers and the average age. \n\nBut wait, the tools available don't include a CSV reader. The tools I have are for reading files, writing files, etc., but not specifically for processing CSV data. The read_file tool can read the file, but I need to parse the CSV content to extract the necessary data. However, since I can't execute Python code here, maybe I need to use the python_execute_code tool to run a script that processes the CSV. But the user hasn't provided the CSV content, so I can't process it directly. \n\nWait, the user is asking me to create the JSON summary. But without being able to read the CSV data, how can I compute the total customers and average age? The tools available don't include a CSV parser. The read_file tool can read the file, but I need to process it. Since I can't run Python code here, maybe I need to use the python_execute_code tool to run a script that reads the CSV and calculates the required values. But the user hasn't provided the CSV content, so I can't do that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the read_file tool to get the content of the CSV and then manually calculate the values. But that's not feasible if the CSV is large. However, the user might be expecting a hypothetical scenario where the CSV is processed. \n\nWait, the user's instruction is to create the JSON summary. So perhaps the answer is to use the read_file tool to get the CSV content, then process it to find the total customers and average age, then write the JSON to the specified file. But since I can't process the CSV data here, maybe the answer is to use the read_file tool to get the content and then use the python_execute_code tool to process it. \n\nBut the user hasn't provided the CSV content, so I can't actually process it. Therefore, the correct approach is to use the read_file tool to get the CSV content, then use the python_execute_code tool to run a script that parses the CSV and calculates the required values. Then, write the results to the JSON file. \n\nBut the user's question is to create the JSON summary. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the CSV file using read_file.\n2. Use python_execute_code to process the CSV data.\n3. Write the results to the JSON file.\n\nHowever, since I can't execute code here, maybe the answer is to use the read_file tool to get the content, then use the python_execute_code tool to process it. But the user's answer needs to be in the form of tool calls. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the JSON file is created with the calculated values, but without actual data processing, the answer is to use the read_file tool and then write the JSON. But that's not possible without knowing the data. \n\nWait, the user's instruction is to create the JSON summary. So the answer is to use the read_file tool to get the CSV content, then use the python_execute_code tool to process it, then write the JSON. But since I can't do that here, perhaps the answer is to use the read_file tool to get the CSV content, then use the python_execute_code tool to process it, and then write the JSON. \n\nBut the user is expecting me to generate the tool calls. So the first step is to read the CSV file. Then, use the python_execute_code tool to process the CSV and calculate the required values. Then, write the JSON file with the results. \n\nSo the first tool call would be read_file with the path to the CSV. Then, execute a Python script that reads the CSV, calculates the total customers and average age, and writes the JSON. Then, write the JSON file with the results. \n\nBut the user's answer needs to be in the form of tool calls. So the first step is to read the CSV file.
