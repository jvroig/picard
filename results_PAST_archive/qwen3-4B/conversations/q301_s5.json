Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s5/library/crm_export.csv. The goal is to calculate the total number of customers and the average age from this data. Then, I have to create another JSON file at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s5/cust.json with the keys total_customers and average_age.\n\nBut wait, the tools available don't include a CSV reader. The tools are like read_file, write_file, etc. So maybe I need to use the read_file tool to get the contents of the CSV. Once I have the data, I can process it to find the total customers and average age. However, the user hasn't provided the actual data, so I have to assume that the CSV has the necessary fields.\n\nBut the problem is, the read_file tool can read the file, but how do I process the CSV data? The user might expect that the CSV has columns like 'customer' and 'age', but without knowing the structure, I can't be sure. However, the user's instruction is to create the JSON summary, so I'll proceed under the assumption that the CSV has the required data.\n\nSo first, I'll use the read_file tool to read the CSV file. Then, I'll need to parse the data to count the total customers and calculate the average age. But since the tools don't include a CSV parser, I have to handle this manually. Wait, but the user might be expecting that the CSV is in a format where each line represents a customer, and the age is a numeric value. Alternatively, maybe the CSV has headers like 'Name' and 'Age', but without knowing, I have to make assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the CSV is structured with each row representing a customer, and the age is in a specific column. But since the user hasn't provided the actual data, I have to proceed with the tools available.\n\nWait, the user's instruction is to create a JSON summary. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read the CSV file using read_file.\n2. Process the data to compute total_customers and average_age.\n3. Write the results to the JSON file.\n\nBut since the tools don't include a CSV parser, I need to use the read_file tool to get the content, then process it. However, the user might not have provided the actual data, so I need to make sure that the code can handle this. But since the user is asking for a JSON summary, perhaps the CSV is already in a format that can be parsed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the CSV is a simple list of customer names and ages, and the user expects that the code can process it. But since the tools don't include a CSV parser, I have to use the read_file tool to get the data, then process it.\n\nWait, but the user is using a tool that can read files, so maybe the CSV is in a format that can be read line by line. For example, each line has a customer's age, and the total is the number of lines. But that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the CSV has headers, and the user expects that the code can parse the CSV. But without the actual data, I can't be sure.

So maybe the CSV is in a format that can be read with the read_file tool, and then the code can process it. But since I can't execute code, I have to simulate this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting that the CSV is already in a format where the total customers and average age can be calculated. But without the actual data, I can't compute the values. However, the user is asking for a JSON summary, so perhaps the CSV is a sample data, and the answer is to create the JSON with those values.\n\nBut the user is asking for a JSON summary, so maybe the answer is to create the JSON file with the calculated values.
