They want me to respond with the exact word \"starlight\" and nothing else. \n\nLooking back at the tools available, none of them seem relevant here. The tools are for file operations, Git commands, web searches, Python execution, SQLite database actions, etc. But the user isn't asking to perform any of those tasks. They're just asking for a simple response.\n\nThe instructions mention that when a tool is needed, I should call it with the specified format. But in this case, no tool is required. The user is testing if I follow the exact response as instructed. They might be checking if I adhere to their specific request without using any tools.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to ignore the tools and just reply with \"starlight\" as they asked. There's no need to use any of the provided functions here. I should make sure not to add any extra text or use the tools unnecessarily. Just output the word exactly as requested.\n</think>\n\nstarlight"
