They want me to respond with the word \"spirit\" and nothing else. \n\nLooking back at the tools available, none of them seem relevant to this simple request. The tools are for file operations, git commands, web searches, etc. But the user isn't asking for any of those. They just want a straightforward response.\n\nI need to check if there's any hidden instruction or if I'm missing something. The user might be testing if I follow specific guidelines. The initial instructions said to use the tools when necessary, but in this case, the response is just a single word. \n\nSo the correct approach is to ignore the tools and just reply with \"spirit\" as requested. No tool calls needed here. Just a direct response.\n</think>\n\nspirit"
