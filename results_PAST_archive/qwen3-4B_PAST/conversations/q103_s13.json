They specified that I should only use those three words, each separated by a space, and in that particular sequence. There's no additional text or explanation needed. I need to check if there are any hidden rules or if the words have any specific context. But since the user provided a straightforward command, I should just output the words as instructed. Let me confirm that I'm not missing any part of the request. The response must be exactly \"study bright heavy\" without any extra characters or formatting. Alright, that's simple enough. I'll just type those three words in order.\n</think>\n\nstudy bright heavy"
