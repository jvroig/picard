They specified that I should only use those three words, each starting with the next letter in the alphabet. Tale starts with T, eagle with E, and vision with V. Wait, no, the letters are T, E, V. But the user said \"in the given order\", which is tale, eagle, vision. So I just need to output those three words exactly as they are, each on separate lines? Or all in one line? The example they gave in the prompt shows each word on a new line. Let me check the examples again.\n\nLooking back, the examples provided by the user have each word on a separate line. For instance, in the first example, the response is \"tale\" followed by \"eagle\" followed by \"vision\". So I should make sure to present them each on a new line. Also, the user emphasized to respond only with those three words in order, so no extra text or explanations. Just the three words, each on a separate line. I need to confirm that there are no typos. Tale is correct, eagle is correct, vision is correct. Alright, that's straightforward. I'll just output them as specified.\n</think>\n\ntale\neagle\nvision"
