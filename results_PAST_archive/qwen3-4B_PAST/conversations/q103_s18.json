They specified that I should only use those three words, each separated by a space, and in that particular sequence. There's no additional text or explanation needed. I need to check if there are any hidden rules or if there's a specific context where these words might be part of a larger response. But according to the problem statement, the user is clear: just output those three words. I should ignore any other possible interpretations and strictly adhere to the instruction. Let me confirm that there are no typos and that each word is spelled correctly. \"Ancient\" is correct, \"scanner\" is correct, and \"draft\" is correct. The order is important: ancient first, then scanner, then draft. No punctuation or extra spaces. Just the three words in a straight line. Alright, that's straightforward. I'll generate the response as instructed.\n</think>\n\nancient scanner draft"
