They specified to respond only with those three words, each separated by a space. I need to check if there's any hidden instruction or if there's a tool I need to use here. But looking at the tools provided, none of them seem related to generating a simple text response. The tools are for file operations, git commands, web searches, etc. Since the user's request is straightforward and doesn't require any of the tools, I should just output the exact phrase as instructed. No need to call any functions here. Just make sure the response is precise and follows the given format.\n</think>\n\nvault ancient butterfly"
