They specified that I should not use any tools or explanations, just the exact three words. I need to check if there's any hidden requirement or if I'm missing something. The previous examples show that when a tool is needed, it's called with the correct format. But in this case, the user is asking for a simple response without any actions. So, I should just output those three words without any additional text. Let me confirm that there's no typo and that the words are in the correct sequence. Yes, \"system\", then \"router\", then \"network\". Alright, that's all.\n</think>\n\nsystem router network"
