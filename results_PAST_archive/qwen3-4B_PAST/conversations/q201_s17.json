They specified to reply only with the contents of that line and nothing else. Let me see which tool to use here.\n\nLooking at the available tools, the read_file function seems appropriate. It allows reading a file with parameters for path, show_line_numbers, start_line, end_line, and show_repr. The user is asking for line 34 specifically, so I should set start_line to 34 and end_line to 34. Also, since they want the line content without any extra formatting, I should set show_line_numbers to False and show_repr to False. \n\nWait, the default for show_line_numbers is False, so maybe I don't need to specify that. But to be safe, maybe include it. The parameters would be path: \"/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q201_s17/vision/notes.txt\", start_line: 34, end_line: 34. That should retrieve just line 34. \n\nI need to make sure the tool call is correctly formatted. The input should be a JSON object with those parameters. Let me structure the tool call accordingly. Once the tool returns the content, I'll just output that line without any additional text. Alright, that should do it.\n</think>\n\n[[qwen-tool-start]]\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"read_file\",\n    \"input\": {\n        \"path\": \"/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q201_s17/vision/notes.txt\",\n        \"start_line\": 34,\n        \"end_line\": 34\n    }\n}\n```\n"
