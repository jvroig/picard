They specified to reply only with the contents of that line and nothing else. Let me figure out how to use the available tools.\n\nLooking at the tools, the read_file function can read a file with parameters for line numbers. The parameters include path, show_line_numbers, start_line, end_line, and show_repr. The user is asking for line 34, so I need to set start_line to 34. Since they want only that line, end_line should be 34 as well. Show_line_numbers should be True to display the line numbers, but the user said to reply only with the line content, not the numbers. Wait, but the tool's return is the formatted content. Maybe setting show_line_numbers to True will include the line number in the output, but the user wants only the line. Hmm, maybe I should set show_line_numbers to False and just specify start_line and end_line. But the tool's description says that if show_line_numbers is True, it includes line numbers. However, the user wants only the line content, so perhaps setting show_line_numbers to False and specifying start_line=34 and end_line=34. But the tool's parameters have start_line and end_line as 1-indexed. So, I need to call read_file with path set to the given file, start_line=34, end_line=34, and show_line_numbers=False. That way, the output should just be the content of line 34 without any line numbers. Let me make sure. The tool returns the contents of the file, potentially formatted. So if I set show_line_numbers to False, it should return the line without numbers. Then, the response will be just the line's content. Alright, that's the plan.\n</think>\n\n[[qwen-tool-start]]\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"read_file\",\n    \"input\": {\n        \"path\": \"/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q201_s3/desert/notes.txt\",\n        \"start_line\": 34,\n        \"end_line\": 34,\n        \"show_line_numbers\": false\n    }\n}\n```\n"
