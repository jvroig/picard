Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s20/elegant/crm_export.csv. The goal is to calculate two things: the total number of customers and the average age. \n\nBut wait, the tools available don't include a CSV reader. The tools I have are for reading files, writing files, etc., but not for processing CSV data. The read_file tool can read the file, but I need to parse the CSV data myself. Since I can't execute Python code here, maybe I need to use the python_execute_file tool? But the user hasn't provided a Python script. Hmm, maybe I should check if there's a way to process the CSV using the available tools.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the read_file tool to get the data and then calculate the required values manually. But that's not feasible because the CSV might have a lot of data, and I can't process it without a parser. Wait, the user might have a Python script that can handle this, but since I don't have access to that, perhaps I need to inform them that I can't process the CSV directly with the available tools. However, the user is asking me to create the JSON, so maybe I need to use the read_file tool to get the data and then compute the totals and average age.\n\nWait, the user might be expecting me to use the python_execute_code tool. Let me check the available tools again. There's a python_execute_code tool that can run arbitrary Python code. So maybe I can write a Python script that reads the CSV, calculates the totals, and then writes the JSON to the specified file.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the CSV data, so I need to read it. Let me try using the read_file tool first to get the contents of the CSV. Then, I can process that data in Python. However, the user's instruction is to create the JSON summary, so maybe I need to use the python_execute_code tool to run a script that does this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the read_file tool to get the data and then compute the values manually. But that's not practical for a CSV with many rows. Since I can't process the CSV data without a parser, I need to use the python_execute_code tool to run a Python script that reads the CSV, calculates the required values, and writes the JSON.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Use read_file to get the contents of the CSV file.\n2. Use python_execute_code to run a script that processes the CSV data, calculates total customers and average age, then writes the JSON to the specified path.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the CSV data, so I need to read it first. Let me start by reading the CSV file using the read_file tool. Then, I can use the python_execute_code tool to process it.\n\nWait, but the user's request is to create the JSON file. So maybe I need to combine these steps. Let me check the available tools again. The python_execute_code tool can execute code, so I can write a Python script that reads the CSV, processes it, and writes the JSON. But I need to have the code for that. Since I don't have the CSV data, I can't know the exact code, but I can write a general script.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the read_file tool to get the data and then compute the values. But without knowing the structure of the CSV, I can't proceed. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the python_execute_code tool with a script that reads the CSV, calculates the required values, and writes the JSON.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Use the read_file tool to get the CSV data.\n- Then, use the python_execute_code tool to run a script that processes the data.\n\nBut the user's instruction is to create the JSON, so maybe the code should be written in the python_execute_code tool. Let me structure the tool calls accordingly.\n\nFirst, read the CSV file to get its contents. Then, use the python_execute_code tool to process that data. However, the python_execute_code tool requires the code to be provided as a string. So, I need to write a Python script that reads the CSV data from the file, processes it, and writes the JSON to the specified path.\n\nBut how to pass the CSV data to the Python script? The script would need to read the CSV file, which is in the same directory, but the user's path is /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s20/elegant/crm_export.csv. So the Python script would need to"
