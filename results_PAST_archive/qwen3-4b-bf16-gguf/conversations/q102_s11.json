They want me to respond with the word \"driver\" and nothing else. \n\nLooking back at the tools available, none of them seem to be related to generating a simple response like that. The tools are mostly for file operations, Git commands, web searches, etc. But the user isn't asking to perform any of those actions. They just want a specific word as a response.\n\nSince the instructions say to respond only with the word \"driver\" and nothing more, I should comply without using any tools. The example responses in the tools show that when a tool is called, the response includes the tool call in the specified format. However, in this case, no tool is needed because the user's request is straightforward and doesn't require any of the available functions.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include any additional text or explanations. Just the word \"driver\" as the response. No markdown, just plain text. Let me double-check the user's message to confirm there's no hidden request or command. The user clearly stated to respond only with the word \"driver\", so I'll adhere to that.\n</think>\n\ndriver"
