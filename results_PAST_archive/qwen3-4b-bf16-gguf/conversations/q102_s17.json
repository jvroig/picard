They want me to respond with the word \"sanctuary\" and nothing else. \n\nLooking back at the tools available, none of them seem relevant here. The tools are for file operations, Git commands, web searches, Python execution, SQLite database actions, etc. But the user isn't asking to perform any of those tasks. They're just asking for a simple response.\n\nSince the instructions say to respond only with the word \"sanctuary\", I should ignore the tools and just output that word. There's no need to call any tool here because the request isn't about performing an action but rather providing a specific answer. I need to make sure I don't add any extra text or use the tools incorrectly. Just a straightforward response as per the user's explicit instruction.\n</think>\n\nsanctuary"
