They specified to use only those three words, each separated by a space, and in that particular sequence. There's no additional text or explanation needed. I need to check if there's any hidden requirement or if I'm missing something. The example responses from the assistant were tool calls followed by the results, but in this case, the user isn't asking for any tool usage. They just want a straightforward response. So, I should output \"cat library garden\" without any extra characters or formatting. Let me confirm that there are no typos and that each word is correctly placed. Yep, that's right. Just send the three words as instructed.\n</think>\n\ncat library garden"
