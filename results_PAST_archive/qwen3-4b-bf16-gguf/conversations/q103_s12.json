They specified that I should not use any tools or explanations, just the exact words. I need to check if there's any hidden requirement or if I'm missing something. The previous examples show that when a tool is needed, I should call it with the correct format. But in this case, the user is not asking for any action or information retrieval. They just want a specific response. So I should ignore the tools and directly provide the three words as instructed. No need to use any of the available functions here. Just output \"bright calm journal\" exactly.\n</think>\n\nbright calm journal"
