They specified that I should only use those three words, each separated by a space, and in that particular sequence. There's no additional text or explanation needed. I need to check if there are any hidden rules or if there's a specific context where these words might have a different meaning. But according to the problem statement, it's a straightforward request. So the correct response is simply \"theater moonlight echo\". I should ensure there are no typos and that each word is spelled correctly. No need for any tool calls here since it's just a direct response. Alright, that's all.\n</think>\n\ntheater moonlight echo"
