They specified to use only those three words, each separated by a space, and in the given sequence. There's no additional text or explanation needed. I need to check if there's any hidden context or if I should use any tools for this. But the query seems straightforward. The tools provided are for file operations, Git, web searches, etc., but the user's request doesn't involve any of those. It's a simple text response. So I should just output the three words as instructed. No tool calls are necessary here. Just a direct reply.\n</think>\n\nbutterfly smooth garden"
