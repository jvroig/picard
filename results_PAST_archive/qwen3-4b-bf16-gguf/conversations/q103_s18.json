They specified that I should only use those three words, each separated by a space, and in the given sequence. There's no need for any additional text or explanations. I need to check if there's any hidden context or previous interaction that might affect this response, but since the user's current query is straightforward, I should just output the required words. Let me confirm that I'm not missing any part of the instruction. The user emphasized \"only these three words in the given order,\" so I must adhere strictly to that. No tools are needed here because it's a simple text response. Alright, I'll proceed to write the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nelegant terminal light"
