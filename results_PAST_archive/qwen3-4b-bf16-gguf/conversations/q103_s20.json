They specified that I should only output those three words in order, no explanations or anything else. So I need to check if there's any hidden context or tool call required here. But looking at the tools available, none of them seem related to generating a specific phrase. The user might be testing if I follow instructions strictly. Since the tools are for file operations, git, web searches, etc., but the request is just a simple text response. Therefore, I should ignore the tools and just output the exact words as instructed. No tool calls needed here. Just the three words in sequence.\n</think>\n\nrecord wonder kernel"
