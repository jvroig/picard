They specified that I should only use those three words, each separated by a space. I need to check if there's any hidden requirement or if I'm missing something. The previous examples show that when tools are called, the response is structured with the tool calls and then the summary. But in this case, the user isn't asking for a tool call; they're just requesting a specific response. So I should ignore the tools and just output the exact phrase. Let me confirm that there's no additional context or parameters needed. The user's message is straightforward, so I'll just provide the required words in order.\n</think>\n\nboulder ocean draft"
