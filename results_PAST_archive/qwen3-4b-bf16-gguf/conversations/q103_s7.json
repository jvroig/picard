They said to respond only with those three words, each separated by a space. I need to check if there's any hidden instruction or if there's a specific context I'm missing. But looking back, the user's message is straightforward. They just want the three words in sequence. I should ignore any previous tools or functions mentioned and just output the required phrase. Let me confirm that there's no typo and that each word is spelled correctly. \"Stormy\" is correct, \"chamber\" is correct, and \"dog\" is correct. Alright, I'll present them in order without any additional text.\n</think>\n\nstormy chamber dog"
