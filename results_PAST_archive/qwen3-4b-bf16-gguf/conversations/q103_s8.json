They specified to respond only with those three words, each separated by a space. I need to check if there's any hidden requirement or if I should use any tools for this. But the query doesn't mention anything about using tools, just a straightforward response. Since the user is testing if I follow instructions strictly, I should just output the three words without any additional text. No need to call any tools here. Just a simple reply with the exact phrase.\n</think>\n\ntiny bright rough"
