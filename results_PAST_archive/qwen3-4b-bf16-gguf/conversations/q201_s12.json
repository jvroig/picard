They specified to reply only with the contents of that line and nothing else.\n\nFirst, I need to use the read_file tool. The parameters required are path, show_line_numbers, start_line, end_line, and show_repr. The path is given, so I'll set that. Since they want line 34 specifically, I should set start_line to 34 and end_line to 34. show_line_numbers should be True to display the line numbers, but the user just wants the content, not the numbers. Wait, but the tool's description says that if show_line_numbers is True, the output includes line numbers. However, the user says to reply only with the line's content. Hmm, maybe setting show_line_numbers to False and using start_line=34, end_line=34 would get just the line without numbers. But the tool's default for show_line_numbers is False. Let me check the parameters again. The default for show_line_numbers is False, so maybe I can leave it as default. But to be safe, perhaps set show_line_numbers to False to avoid any line numbers in the output. But the user might not want any extra info. Alternatively, maybe the tool will return the line without numbers if show_line_numbers is False. Let me confirm. The tool's description says that if show_line_numbers is True, line numbers are included. So if I set it to False, the output should just be the line's content. So the parameters would be path: \"/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q201_s12/database/notes.txt\", start_line: 34, end_line: 34, show_line_numbers: False. That should get the exact line. Then, the response from the tool would be the line's content. Then I can just output that line as the answer. Let me make sure the tool call is correctly formatted. The tool name is read_file, and the input parameters are path, show_line_numbers, start_line, end_line. So the JSON should have those parameters. Alright, I'll structure the tool call accordingly.\n</think>\n\n[[qwen-tool-start]]\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"read_file\",\n    \"input\": {\n        \"path\": \"/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q201_s12/database/notes.txt\",\n        \"start_line\": 34,\n        \"end_line\": 34\n    }\n}\n```\n[[qwen-tool-end"
