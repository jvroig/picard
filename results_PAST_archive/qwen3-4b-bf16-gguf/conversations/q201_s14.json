They specified to reply only with the contents of that line and nothing else.\n\nFirst, I need to use the read_file tool. The parameters required are path, show_line_numbers, start_line, end_line, and show_repr. The path is given, so I'll set that. Since they want line 34, I should set start_line to 34. The end_line can be left as default (None) because they only need one line. Show_line_numbers should be True to display the line numbers, but the user didn't ask for line numbers, just the content. Wait, but the tool's parameters include show_line_numbers, which defaults to False. However, the user wants the actual line content, so maybe I need to set show_line_numbers to True to get the line number, but the user didn't ask for that. Hmm, maybe the tool's output includes line numbers when show_line_numbers is True. But the user only wants the line's content. Wait, the tool's description says that if show_line_numbers is True, the output includes line numbers. But the user wants only the line's content. So perhaps I should set show_line_numbers to False, and just specify start_line=34. But the tool's parameters for read_file have start_line as 1-indexed. So I need to call read_file with path set to the given file, start_line=34, and maybe end_line=34 to get just that line. Also, show_line_numbers is False by default, so that's okay. But the user wants only the line's content, so the tool's output should return that line without any extra info. Let me check the tool's parameters again. The read_file tool's parameters: path is required, show_line_numbers is optional (default False), start_line (default 1), end_line (default None), show_repr (default False). So to get line 34, I should set start_line=34 and end_line=34. That way, it reads only that line. Then, the output will be the content of line 34. So the tool call should be read_file with path \"/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q201_s14/epic/notes.txt\", start_line=34, end_line=34, and show_line_numbers=False. Then, the response will be the line's content. The user wants only that line, so after getting the result, I can just output it. But I need to make sure that the tool call is correctly formatted. Let me structure the JSON accordingly.\n</think>\n\n[[qwen-tool-start]]\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"read_file\",\n    \"input\": {\n        \"path\": \"/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q201_s14/epic/notes.txt\",\n        \"start_line\": 34,\n        \"end_line\": 34\n    }\n}\n```\n[[qwen-tool-end"
