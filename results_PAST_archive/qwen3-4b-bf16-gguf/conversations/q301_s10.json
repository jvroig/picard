Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s10/lake/crm_export.csv. The goal is to calculate two things: the total number of customers and the average age. \n\nBut wait, the tools available don't include a CSV reader. The tools I have are for reading files, writing files, etc., but not for processing CSV data. The read_file tool can read the file, but I need to parse the CSV content to extract the necessary data. Since I can't process CSV data directly with the provided tools, maybe I need to use the read_file tool to get the content and then manually parse it. However, the user might expect that I can handle this without explicit parsing steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the CSV is in a format where the first row is headers, and each subsequent row represents a customer. So, the total customers would be the number of rows, and the average age would be the sum of the 'age' column divided by the number of customers. \n\nBut since I don't have a tool to process CSV data, I need to use the read_file tool to get the content, then process it. However, the user's instructions might require that I use the available tools. Wait, the tools don't include a CSV parser, so perhaps I need to use the read_file tool to get the content, then process it in my own code. But since I can't execute code here, maybe I need to simulate that. \n\nWait, the user is asking me to create a JSON summary. So, the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the CSV file using read_file.\n2. Parse the CSV data to calculate total customers and average age.\n3. Write the results to a JSON file.\n\nBut since I can't execute code, I need to use the tools provided. However, the tools don't include a CSV parser. Therefore, maybe I need to use the read_file tool to get the content, then process it manually. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that I can use the read_file tool to get the content, and then use the write_file tool to create the JSON. But without processing the CSV data, I can't compute the required values. \n\nWait, perhaps the user is expecting that I can use the read_file tool to get the content, then parse it. But since I can't do that here, maybe I need to simulate that. However, the user might not be aware of the limitations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the CSV file is in a simple format where the first row is headers, and each row has 'age' as a column.
