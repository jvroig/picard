Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s14/echo/crm_export.csv. The goal is to calculate the total number of customers and the average age from this data. Then, I have to create another JSON file at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s14/cust.json with these two values.\n\nBut wait, the tools available don't include a CSV reader. The tools are for file operations like read_file, write_file, etc. So I need to use the read_file tool to get the contents of the CSV. Once I have the data, I'll need to process it to find the total customers and average age. However, the user hasn't provided the actual data, so I'll have to assume that the CSV has columns like 'customer_id' and 'age' or similar.\n\nBut since I can't process the data here, maybe the user expects me to use the read_file tool to get the data, then parse it. But the tools don't have a built-in CSV parser. Hmm, maybe the user expects me to handle this step-by-step. Wait, the user might be expecting that after reading the file, I can process the data in my mind, but since I can't actually process it, perhaps I need to use the read_file tool first to get the data, then calculate the required values.\n\nWait, but the user is asking me to create the JSON summary. Since I can't process the CSV data directly, maybe I need to first read the file using the read_file tool, then parse the data to compute the total customers and average age. However, the tools available don't include a CSV parser, so I might need to use the read_file tool to get the data as a string, then manually parse it. But since I can't actually do that here, maybe the user is expecting that I can handle it through the tools provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting that the JSON file is created with the calculated values, but without actually processing the data. But that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the user is expecting that I can use the read_file tool to get the data, then process it, but since I can't do that here, maybe I need to proceed step by step.\n\nWait, the user's instruction is to create a JSON summary of the CSV, so the first step is to read the CSV file. Let me start by using the read_file tool to get the contents of the CSV. Then, I can process the data to find the total customers and average age. But since I can't actually process the data here, maybe the user is expecting that I can do that in the tool's response. However, the tools don't have a built-in CSV parser, so I need to assume that the data is in a format that can be parsed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting that after reading the file, the JSON is created with the calculated values. But since I can't process the data, perhaps the user is expecting that I can use the read_file tool to get the data, then compute the values, then write them to the JSON file.\n\nSo, first, I'll use the read_file tool to read the CSV file. Then, I'll need to parse the data to find the total number of customers and the average age. Once I have those values, I'll use the write_file tool to create the JSON file with those values.\n\nBut since I can't actually process the data here, maybe the user is expecting that I can do that in the tool's response. However, the tools don't have a built-in CSV parser, so I need to proceed step by step.\n\nWait, the user's instruction is to create a JSON summary. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read the CSV file using read_file.\n2. Parse the CSV data to calculate total_customers and average_age.\n3. Write the JSON file with these values.\n\nBut since I can't process the data, perhaps I need to use the read_file tool first, then manually compute the values. However, since I don't have the actual data, I can't do that. Therefore, maybe the user is expecting that the JSON file is created with placeholder values, but that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting that I can use the read_file tool to get the data, then use the python_execute_code tool to process it. But the user hasn't provided that tool's usage here. Wait, the tools include python_execute_code, which can execute arbitrary Python code. So perhaps I can use that to process the CSV data.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Use read_file to get"
