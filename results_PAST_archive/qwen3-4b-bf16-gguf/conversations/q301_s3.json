Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s3/note/crm_export.csv. The goal is to calculate two things: the total number of customers and the average age. \n\nWait, but the tools available don't include a CSV reader. The tools are for reading files, writing files, etc., but not for processing CSV data. The read_file tool can read the file, but I need to parse the CSV data to get the required metrics. Since I can't use Python's pandas or any other library here, maybe I need to process the CSV manually.\n\nHmm, the user might expect me to use the read_file tool to get the contents of the CSV, then process that data. But since I can't execute code, I have to simulate this. Wait, but the tools available don't include a CSV parser. The user might be expecting me to use the read_file tool to get the data, then calculate the total customers and average age based on that. However, without actual data, I can't compute the numbers. But the user is asking me to create the JSON file, so maybe I need to assume that the CSV has the necessary data.\n\nWait, the user's instruction is to create the JSON summary. So perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Read the CSV file using read_file.\n2. Parse the CSV data to count the total customers and calculate the average age.\n3. Write the results to a JSON file.\n\nBut since I can't process the CSV data here, maybe I need to use the read_file tool to get the data, then simulate the processing. However, the user might not have provided the actual data, so I need to make assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the CSV is structured in a way that can be processed with the available tools.\n\nWait, the user is asking me to create the JSON file, so perhaps the CSV is already in a format where the total customers and average age can be derived. But without the actual data, I can't compute the numbers. However, the user is expecting me to generate the JSON, so maybe I need to use the read_file tool to get the data, then process it.\n\nBut since I can't run code, I need to simulate the processing. For example, if the CSV has a 'customer' column and 'age' column, then the total customers would be the number of rows, and the average age would be the sum of ages divided by the number of customers.\n\nBut since I can't actually process the data here, maybe I need to use the read_file tool to get the data, then use the python_execute_code tool to process it. Wait, but the user hasn't provided the actual data. So maybe the answer is to use the read_file tool to get the data, then use the python_execute_code tool to process it and generate the JSON.\n\nBut the user's instruction is to create the JSON file. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the CSV file using read_file.\n2. Use python_execute_code to process the data and calculate the required metrics.\n3. Write the results to the JSON file.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the actual data, so I need to make assumptions. However, the user might be expecting me to use the available tools to perform these steps. Let me check the available tools again.\n\nThe available tools include read_file, write_file, and python_execute_code. So the plan is:\n\n- Use read_file to get the contents of the CSV.\n- Use python_execute_code to process the CSV data and compute the total customers and average age.\n- Use write_file to save the results to the JSON file.\n\nBut since I can't actually run code, I need to simulate this. However, the user's answer must be in the format of tool calls. So I need to first read the CSV, then process it with Python code, then write the JSON.\n\nSo the first step is to read the CSV file. Let me call the read_file tool with the path to the CSV file.\n\nThen, once I have the data, I can use the python_execute_code tool to process it. But since I don't have the actual data, I need to simulate the processing. However, the user's answer must be in the form of tool calls, so I need to structure it accordingly.\n\nWait, but the user is asking me to create the JSON summary. So the answer would involve using the read_file tool to get the CSV data, then using the python_execute_code tool to process it, then using write_file to save the JSON.\n\nBut the user's answer must be in the form of tool calls.
