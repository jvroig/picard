      "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to create a JSON summary of a CSV file and save it as a JSON file. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s5/kernel/crm_export.csv. The goal is to calculate two things: the total number of customers and the average age. \n\nWait, but how do I read the CSV? The tools available don't include a CSV reader directly. Oh, right, there's the read_file tool. Maybe I can use that to read the CSV file. But the read_file tool is for reading text files, and CSVs are text files. So I can use read_file with the path to the CSV.\n\nOnce I have the content of the CSV, I need to parse it. The CSV probably has headers like 'customer' and 'age'. So I'll need to process each line, count the customers, and sum the ages. But the user hasn't provided the actual data, so I have to assume the structure. Let's say each line represents a customer, with age as a number.\n\nSo the steps would be: read the CSV, split into lines, count the number of lines (total customers), sum all the ages and divide by the count for average age.\n\nBut wait, the read_file tool can take parameters like show_line_numbers, start_line, end_line, etc. Maybe I can read the entire file and then process it. However, the user might have a large file, but since the tool is available, I can proceed.\n\nOnce I have the data, I need to create a JSON file at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s5/cust.json with the two keys: total_customers and average_age.\n\nBut how to handle the CSV data? Let's think. The read_file tool will return the content as a string. So I need to parse that string. For example, if the CSV is:\n\ncustomer,age\n1,30\n2,25\n3,35\n\nThen the total customers is 3, average age is 30.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Use read_file to get the CSV content.\n2. Process the content to extract the total customers and average age.\n3. Write the results to the JSON file.\n\nBut the user's tools don't include a CSV parser. So I need to handle this in the code. Wait, but the tools available are for file operations, not data processing. So maybe I need to use the python_execute_code tool to run a Python script that reads the CSV and calculates the stats.\n\nWait, the user has a tool called python_execute_code. So perhaps I can use that. Let me check the available tools again. Yes, there's python_execute_code which can execute arbitrary Python code.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Use python_execute_code to run a script that reads the CSV file, processes it, and writes the JSON.\n\nBut how to structure that code? Let's think. The code would need to open the CSV file, read each line, skip the header, sum the ages, count the customers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the read_file tool to get the CSV content as a string, then process that string in the code.\n\nBut since the user is asking for a JSON summary, perhaps the code would be:\n\nRead the CSV file, split into lines, process each line, calculate total and average.\n\nBut the code would need to be written in Python. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the CSV file using read_file, but maybe the code can use the built-in csv module.\n\nAlternatively, the code can use the read_file tool to get the content, then process it.\n\nBut since the user is using the python_execute_code tool, I can write a Python script that does the following:\n\n- Open the CSV file (path: /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s5/kernel/crm_export.csv)\n- Use csv.reader to parse the file.\n- Iterate over each row, sum the ages, count the customers.\n- Then write the results to the JSON file.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport csv\nimport json\n\ncsv_path = '/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s5/kernel/crm_export.csv'\njson_path = '/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s5/cust.json'\n\nwith open(csv_path, 'r') as f:\n    reader = csv.DictReader(f)\n    total = 0\n    age_sum = 0\n    for row in reader:\n        total += 1\n        age_sum += int(row['age'])\n\naverage_age = age_sum / total if total > 0 else 0\n\nwith open(json_path, 'w') as f:\n"
