Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s6/memoir/crm_export.csv. The goal is to calculate two things: the total number of customers and the average age. \n\nWait, but the tools available don't include a CSV reader. The tools are like read_file, write_file, etc. So maybe I need to use the read_file tool to get the contents of the CSV. But the CSV might have headers, and I need to process the data to count the customers and compute the average age. However, the read_file tool just reads the file's content as a string. Without a parser, I can't process the CSV data directly here. \n\nHmm, but the user might expect that the CSV is in a format where the first row is headers, and each subsequent row represents a customer. So maybe the CSV has columns like 'customer_id' and 'age'. But since I can't process the CSV data here, I need to figure out if there's another way. Wait, maybe the user is expecting me to use the read_file tool to get the data, then process it in some way. But the tools don't include a CSV parser. \n\nWait, but the user is asking for a JSON summary. Maybe the CSV is already structured in a way that can be parsed. Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting me to use the read_file tool to get the data, then process it using Python code. But the tools available include python_execute_code. So perhaps I need to first read the CSV file using read_file, then use Python to process it. \n\nWait, but the user's instructions are to create a JSON summary. So maybe the steps are:\n\n1. Read the CSV file using read_file to get its content as a string.\n2. Use Python to parse the CSV data, calculate total customers and average age.\n3. Then write the results to the JSON file.\n\nBut since the tools don't have a CSV parser, I need to use the read_file tool to get the data, then use the python_execute_code tool to process it. However, the user might not have the necessary code to do that. Alternatively, maybe the CSV is simple enough that I can process it with a script.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting that the CSV is in a format where the first row is headers, and each row is a customer. So the total customers would be the number of rows minus the header. The average age would be the sum of the age column divided by the number of customers.\n\nBut without being able to process the CSV data, I can't compute these values. Therefore, I need to use the read_file tool to get the content, then use Python to parse it. So the plan is:\n\n- Use read_file to get the CSV content.\n- Then, use python_execute_code to process the CSV data and calculate the required values.\n- Then, write the results to the JSON file.\n\nBut the user's tools don't include a CSV parser, so I need to write a Python script that reads the CSV data, processes it, and outputs the required JSON. However, the user might not have the code for that. Alternatively, maybe the CSV is in a simple format that can be handled with basic string manipulation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting that the CSV is already in a format where the first line is the header, and each line after that is a customer. So, for example, the CSV might have columns like 'name', 'age', etc. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to proceed.\n\nWait, the user's instruction is to create a JSON summary with total_customers and average_age. So perhaps the CSV has a column named 'age' and each row represents a customer. Therefore, the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the CSV file using read_file.\n2. Split the content into lines.\n3. Count the number of lines (total_customers) minus 1 (for the header).\n4. Sum the ages from each line and divide by the total_customers to get the average age.\n\nBut how to do that with the available tools? The read_file tool can read the file as a string. Then, using python_execute_code, I can write a script that processes that string.\n\nSo, first, I need to read the CSV file. Let's call the read_file tool with the path to the CSV.\n\nThen, use the python_execute_code tool to process the content. For example, the code would be:\n\nimport csv\nimport sys\n\ncsv_data = sys.stdin.read()\nlines = csv_data.splitlines()\nheader = lines[0]\ndata = lines[1:]\n\ntotal_customers = len"
