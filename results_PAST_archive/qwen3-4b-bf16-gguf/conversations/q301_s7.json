Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s7/mirror/crm_export.csv. The goal is to calculate the total number of customers and the average age from this data. Then, I have to create a new JSON file at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s7/cust.json with these two values.\n\nBut wait, the tools available don't include a CSV reader or a JSON writer. The tools are like read_file, write_file, etc. So I need to use the read_file tool to get the CSV data first. Once I have the data, I can process it to find the total customers and average age. However, the user hasn't provided the actual data, so I have to assume that the CSV has the necessary columns, like 'customer' and 'age'.\n\nBut the problem is, the read_file tool can read the file, but how do I process the data? Since I can't execute code here, maybe I need to use the python_execute_code tool to run a script that reads the CSV and calculates the required values. Wait, but the user didn't mention having Python installed. Hmm, but the tools do include python_execute_code. So maybe I can use that.\n\nWait, the user's instruction is to create a JSON summary. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the CSV file using read_file.\n2. Use python_execute_code to process the CSV data and compute total_customers and average_age.\n3. Write the results to the JSON file using write_file.\n\nBut the user's tools don't include a CSV parser. So maybe the CSV is in a format that can be read by the read_file tool, and then I can process it line by line. However, without knowing the exact structure of the CSV, it's a bit challenging. But the user probably expects that the CSV has columns like 'customer' and 'age', and the code would count the rows and calculate the average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the CSV is already in a format where the total customers can be determined by the number of rows, and the average age is the sum of the age column divided by the number of rows. But since I can't execute code here, I need to use the python_execute_code tool to do that.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Use read_file to get the contents of the CSV.\n- Then, use python_execute_code to run a script that reads the CSV data, processes it, and calculates the required values.\n- Then, use write_file to save the JSON results.\n\nBut the user's tools don't have a CSV parser, so the code would need to handle that. However, the user might not have provided the actual data, so I need to make assumptions. Alternatively, maybe the CSV is a simple file that can be read line by line.\n\nWait, the user's instruction is to create a JSON summary. So the JSON should have total_customers and average_age. The CSV might have each customer's age in a column. So the code would need to read the CSV, count the rows (total_customers), sum the ages, then divide by the count for average_age.\n\nBut since I can't execute code here, I need to use the python_execute_code tool. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the CSV file using read_file to get its content.\n2. Use python_execute_code to process that content and calculate the required values.\n3. Write the results to the JSON file.\n\nBut the problem is that the read_file tool returns the content as a string. So the code would need to read that string, split into lines, process each line, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the CSV is in a format that can be handled by the read_file tool, and then the code can process it. But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting that the CSV is already in a format where the total customers is the number of rows, and the average age is the sum of the age column divided by the number of rows. But since the user hasn't provided the actual data, I have to proceed with the tools available.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Use read_file to get the CSV data.\n- Use python_execute_code to run a script that processes the CSV data and calculates the required values.\n- Use write_file to save the JSON results.\n\nBut the user's tools don't include a CSV parser, so the code would have to handle that.
