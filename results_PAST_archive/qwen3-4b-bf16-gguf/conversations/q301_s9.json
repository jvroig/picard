Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s9/vision/crm_export.csv. The goal is to calculate two things: the total number of customers and the average age. \n\nBut wait, the tools available don't include a CSV reader. The tools I have are for reading files, writing files, etc., but not for processing CSV data. The read_file tool can read the file, but I need to parse the CSV data to get the required metrics. Since I can't execute Python code here, maybe I need to use the python_execute_file tool? But the user hasn't provided a Python script. Hmm, maybe I should check if there's a way to process the CSV using the existing tools.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the read_file tool to get the content of the CSV and then manually calculate the total and average. But that's not feasible because the CSV could be large. Wait, the user might have a Python script that can handle this. But since the user hasn't provided it, perhaps I need to use the python_execute_code tool to run a script that processes the CSV.\n\nWait, the available tools include python_execute_code. So maybe I can use that. Let me think: the user wants the total customers and average age. So I need to write a Python script that reads the CSV, counts the rows (total customers), and calculates the average age. Then, save the result as a JSON file.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the CSV data. So I need to first read the CSV file using read_file, then process it. However, the read_file tool can read the file's content, but I need to parse it. Since I can't execute code here, maybe I need to use the python_execute_code tool to run a script that does this.\n\nWait, the user's instruction is to create the JSON summary. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read the CSV file to get the data.\n2. Process the data to compute total_customers and average_age.\n3. Write the results to a JSON file.\n\nBut since I can't execute code, maybe I need to use the python_execute_code tool. Let me check the available tools again. The python_execute_code tool can execute arbitrary Python code. So I can write a Python script that does the following:\n\n- Read the CSV file using pandas or csv module.\n- Calculate total customers (number of rows).\n- Calculate average age (sum of ages divided by number of customers).\n- Then, write the results to a JSON file.\n\nBut the user might not have pandas installed. Alternatively, use the standard csv module. However, the user might not have the necessary libraries. But since the user is asking me to do this, I can assume that the environment has the necessary tools.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Use python_execute_code to run a script that reads the CSV, processes it, and writes the JSON.\n\nBut the user's CSV is at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s9/vision/crm_export.csv. So the Python code would need to read that file.\n\nBut the problem is that the user might not have the code written. So I need to generate the code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the read_file tool to get the CSV content, then process it manually. But that's not practical for a large file. However, given the tools available, maybe that's the only way.\n\nWait, the user's instruction is to create a JSON summary. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the CSV file using read_file.\n2. Parse the CSV data to extract the necessary fields.\n3. Calculate total_customers and average_age.\n4. Write the results to cust.json.\n\nBut since I can't process the CSV data without code, maybe the user expects me to use the python_execute_code tool. Let me check the available tools again.\n\nYes, the python_execute_code tool is available. So I can use that to run a Python script that processes the CSV.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Use python_execute_code to run a script that reads the CSV, computes the required metrics, and writes the JSON.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the code, so I need to generate it.\n\nThe code would look something like this:\n\nimport csv\nimport json\n\ncsv_file = '/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s9/vision/crm_export.csv'\njson_file = '/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s9/cust.json'\n\ntotal_customers = 0\ntotal_age = 0\n\nwith open(csv_file, 'r') as f:\n   "
