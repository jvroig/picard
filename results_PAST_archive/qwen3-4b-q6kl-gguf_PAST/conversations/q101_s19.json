Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the directory exists. If it doesn't, maybe I should create it first. But the user didn't mention creating the directory, so perhaps it's already there. But to be safe, maybe I should verify that.\n\nWait, the user's instruction is to create the files in that specific directory. So the first step is to make sure that the directory exists. If it's not there, I might need to create it. But the user didn't ask to create the directory, so maybe they assume it's already present. However, if the directory doesn't exist, the file creation would fail. So perhaps I should check and create the directory if necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the directory exists. But since the user hasn't mentioned creating the directory, I should proceed under the assumption that it's already there. But to be thorough, maybe I should first check if the directory exists. If not, create it. Then create the two files.\n\nWait, the tools available include create_directory. So maybe I should use that. Let me check the tools again. The create_directory tool takes a path and returns a confirmation. So first, I can check if the directory exists. If not, create it.\n\nBut the user's exact request is to create the two files in that directory. So perhaps the directory is already there. But to ensure that, maybe I should first check. However, the user might not have created it yet. So maybe the correct approach is to first create the directory if it doesn't exist, then create the files.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the directory exists. But since the user hasn't mentioned it, perhaps I should proceed to create the files, and if the directory doesn't exist, the tool will fail. But the user might not have created the directory yet.

So maybe the directory is already there. However, to be safe, perhaps I should first check if the directory exists. If not, create it. Then create the two files.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Check if the directory /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/compass exists. If not, create it.\n2. Create the two files, swift.log and bright.config, in that directory.\n\nBut how to check if the directory exists? The list_directory tool can list the contents of a directory. If I call list_directory with that path, and if the directory doesn't exist, it would return an error. Alternatively, the create_directory tool would create it if it doesn't exist. Wait, the create_directory tool's parameters are just the path. So if I call create_directory with that path, it will create the directory if it doesn't exist.

So perhaps the correct approach is to first create the directory if it doesn't exist, then create the files.\n\nSo, first, I'll use the create_directory tool to create the directory if it doesn't exist. Then, use write_file or create the files.\n\nWait, the create_directory tool's parameters are just the path. So I can call create_directory with the path /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/compass. Then, after that, create the two files.\n\nBut maybe the directory already exists. So perhaps the first step is to check if the directory exists. But the tools available don't have a 'check if directory exists' tool. The list_directory tool can be used to list the contents.

Alternatively, using create_directory would create it if it doesn't exist. So perhaps the correct approach is to first create the directory, then create the files.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1.
