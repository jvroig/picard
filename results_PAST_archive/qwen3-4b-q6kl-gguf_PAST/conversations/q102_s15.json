They want me to respond with the word \"bright\" and nothing else. \n\nLooking back at the tools available, none of them are related to generating a simple text response like that. The tools are mostly for file operations, Git commands, web searches, etc. But the user isn't asking to perform any of those actions. They just want a straightforward response.\n\nSince the instructions say to respond only with the word \"bright\", I should ignore the tools and just output that word. There's no need to use any tool here because the request isn't asking for a function call. I'll make sure not to add any extra text or explanations.\n</think>\n\nbright"
