They want me to respond with the word \"tiger\" and nothing else. No explanations, no tool calls, just the word \"tiger\". \n\nLooking back at the instructions, I need to ensure that I don't use any tools here because the user is asking for a simple response. The examples provided earlier show that when a tool is needed, I should call it with the appropriate format. But in this case, the user isn't asking for any action that requires a tool. They're just asking for a specific word.\n\nSo, the correct response is to output \"tiger\" exactly as requested. I should avoid any additional text or formatting. Just the word \"tiger\" in the response. Let me double-check the user's message to confirm there's no hidden request or ambiguity. The user clearly states to respond only with that word. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is straightforward. No tool calls are necessary here. Just return \"tiger\".\n</think>\n\ntiger"
