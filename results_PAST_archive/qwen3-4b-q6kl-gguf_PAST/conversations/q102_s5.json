They want me to output the word \"framework\" as the response. There's no additional context provided, so I don't need to use any tools here. My previous responses were examples of tool calls, but this time, the user is testing if I follow the instructions properly. I should ignore any potential follow-up questions and just provide the exact word. Let me check the guidelines again to ensure I'm not missing anything. The user emphasized responding only with the word, so I'll stick to that. No tool calls needed here.\n</think>\n\nframework"
