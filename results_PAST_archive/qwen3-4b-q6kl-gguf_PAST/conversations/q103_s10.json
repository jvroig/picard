They specified that I should only use those three words, each separated by a space, and in that particular sequence. There's no additional text or explanation needed. I need to check if there are any hidden rules or if the words have any specific context. But since the user provided a clear instruction, I should just output those words as is. Let me confirm that there are no typos and that each word is spelled correctly. Memo, mirror, study. Yes, that's right. So the response should be straightforward.\n</think>\n\nmemo mirror study"
