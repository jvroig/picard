They specified that I should only use those three words, each separated by a space, and in that particular sequence. There's no additional text or explanation needed. I need to check if there are any hidden rules or if there's a specific context where these words might be important. But since the user hasn't provided any other information, I should just follow the instruction straightforwardly. Let me confirm that I'm not missing any part of the request. The response must be exactly \"swift protocol spirit\" with no extra characters or formatting. Alright, I'll proceed to output that.\n</think>\n\nswift protocol spirit"
