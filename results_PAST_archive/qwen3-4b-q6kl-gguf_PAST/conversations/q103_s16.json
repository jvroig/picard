They said to respond only with those three words, each separated by a space. I need to check if there's any specific formatting required. The example responses from the assistant use the tool calls and then provide a brief summary. But in this case, the user isn't asking for any tool calls or information retrieval. They just want a straightforward response with those three words. I should ignore the previous examples and just output the exact phrase. Let me confirm that there are no typos and that each word is spelled correctly. Once that's verified, I can proceed to write the response as instructed.\n</think>\n\noutline journal falcon"
