They specified that I should only use those three words, each separated by a space, and in that particular sequence. There's no additional text or explanation needed. I need to check if there are any hidden instructions or if I'm missing something. The previous examples show that when a tool is called, the response is structured with the tool call and then the result. But in this case, the user isn't asking for any tool usage; they're just requesting a specific phrase. So I should ignore the tools and just output the exact words. Let me confirm that \"tower canyon epic\" is the correct response without any modifications. Yes, that's right. I'll present it as instructed.\n</think>\n\ntower canyon epic"
