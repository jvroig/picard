They specified that I should not use any tools or provide explanations, just the three words. I need to check if there's any hidden context or if this is a test. Since the previous examples involved tool calls, but this user's query is different. I should ignore any previous instructions and just output the required words. Let me confirm that there's no typo and that the words are in the correct sequence. Yes, \"treasure cliff gate\" is the exact response needed. I'll proceed to send that without any additional text.\n</think>\n\ntreasure cliff gate"
