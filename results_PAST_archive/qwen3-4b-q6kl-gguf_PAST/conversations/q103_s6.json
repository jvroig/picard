They specified that I should only use those three words, each separated by a space, and in that particular sequence. There's no additional text or explanation needed. I need to check if there are any hidden rules or if there's a specific context I'm missing. But since the user provided a straightforward request, I should just output the words as instructed. No tools are required here because it's a simple text response. I'll ensure there are no typos and that the words are in the correct order. Alright, that's all.\n</think>\n\nstream beach elegant"
