They specified that I should only use those three words, each starting with the next letter in the alphabet. Azure starts with A, forest with F, and wolf with W. I need to check if there's any hidden meaning or if they want a specific format. But the user didn't add any extra instructions, so it's straightforward. I'll just output those words as they are. No need for any additional explanations or tool calls since the task is simple and direct. Let me confirm once more: \"azure forest wolf\" exactly, no typos. Yep, that's it.\n</think>\n\nazure forest wolf"
