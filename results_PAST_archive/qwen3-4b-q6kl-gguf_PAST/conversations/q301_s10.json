      "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this user request. The user wants two things: first, a JSON summary of a CSV file that includes the total number of customers and the average age. Second, they want to create a JSON file at a specific path with those two values.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file. The file is located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s10/legend/crm_export.csv. To get the total customers and average age, I'll need to parse the CSV data. But wait, the tools available don't include a CSV reader. The available tools are for reading files, but the read_file tool can read any file. However, processing the CSV data to calculate the required metrics would require some code. Since the user is asking for a JSON summary, maybe I can use the read_file tool to get the data and then process it.\n\nBut the user also wants to create a JSON file with the results. So perhaps I need to first read the CSV, process it, then write the JSON. However, the tools available don't include a CSV parser. The read_file tool can read the file, but processing the data would require using the python_execute_code tool to run Python code that reads the CSV and calculates the required values.\n\nWait, the user might not have Python code to do that. So maybe I need to use the python_execute_code tool to run a script that reads the CSV and computes the total customers and average age. Then, use the write_file tool to save the results into the cust.json file.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the CSV is in a format where the first column is customer IDs, and the second is age. But without knowing the exact structure, I have to assume that the CSV has a column for customers and an age column. However, the user might not have provided that information, so I need to make an assumption here.\n\nBut the user's instruction is to create a JSON summary of the CSV. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the CSV file to get the data.\n2. Process the data to calculate total customers and average age.\n3. Create a JSON file with these values.\n\nBut how to do that with the available tools? The read_file tool can read the file, but processing it would require Python code. So I need to use the python_execute_code tool to run a script that reads the CSV and computes the required values.\n\nSo first, I'll use the read_file tool to get the content of the CSV. Wait, but the user might not have the CSV data, so maybe the CSV is already present. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the CSV is in a specific format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expecting that the CSV has a column named 'customer' and 'age', but that's an assumption. However, without knowing the exact structure, I can't proceed. But the user's instruction is to create a JSON summary, so I need to process the CSV data.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Use the read_file tool to read the CSV file.\n2. Use the python_execute_code tool to process the CSV data and calculate the required metrics.\n3. Use the write_file tool to save the results into the cust.json file.\n\nBut the problem is that the read_file tool might not be sufficient for processing the data. So perhaps the user expects that the CSV is in a format that can be processed by Python code. Therefore, I need to write a Python script that reads the CSV, counts the total customers, and calculates the average age.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Read the CSV file using the read_file tool to get its content.\n- Then, use the python_execute_code tool to run a script that processes the CSV data.\n- The script would read the CSV data, split it into lines, process each line to extract the necessary information, calculate the total customers and average age.\n- Then, write the results into the cust.json file using the write_file tool.\n\nBut the user might not have the CSV data, but the problem states that the file exists. So the user is expecting that the CSV is present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is using a tool that can process the CSV, but given the available tools, the only way is to use Python code.\n\nSo, the first step is to read the CSV file. Let's use the read_file tool with the path to the CSV file. Then, process the data.\n\nBut the user might not have the CSV data, but the problem says to create the JSON summary. So perhaps the user is expecting that the CSV is in a specific format, and the code can process it.\n\nSo, the first tool call would be to read the CSV file.
