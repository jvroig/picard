Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s7/sanctuary/crm_export.csv. The goal is to calculate two things: the total number of customers and the average age. \n\nBut wait, the tools available don't include a CSV reader. The tools I have are for reading and writing files, but not for processing CSV data. The read_file tool can read a file, but it just returns the content as a string. So I can't directly parse the CSV with that. Hmm, maybe I need to use the read_file tool to get the data, then process it manually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the sqlite tools, but the CSV isn't in a database. Wait, the user mentioned creating a JSON file, so perhaps the CSV is in a format that can be parsed. But without a CSV parser tool, I can't process it. The available tools don't include a CSV parser, so I might need to inform the user that I can't process the CSV directly. However, the user might be expecting me to use the read_file tool to get the content and then manually calculate the totals and average.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction is to create a JSON summary. So maybe I need to first read the CSV file, then process the data. But since I don't have a CSV parser, I can't do that. So perhaps the user is expecting me to use the read_file tool to get the content, then parse it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the CSV is in a format that can be handled by the existing tools. Let me check the available tools again. The read_file tool can read a file, but it just returns the content as a string. So I can read the CSV file, then process it in my mind. But since I can't execute code, I have to do this step-by-step.\n\nWait, the user might be expecting me to use the read_file tool to get the content of the CSV, then calculate the total customers and average age based on that. But how can I do that without a parser? Maybe the CSV has a specific structure, like each line representing a customer with age. For example, if the CSV has columns like 'name' and 'age', then I can count the rows for total customers and sum the ages.\n\nBut since I can't actually parse the CSV, I need to make an assumption. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll use the read_file tool to get the content of the CSV. Then, I'll need to process that content to count the number of rows (total customers) and sum the ages. However, since I can't execute code, I have to simulate this process.\n\nWait, but the user is asking me to create a JSON file with those values. So maybe I need to first read the CSV, then calculate those values, then write the JSON. But without a CSV parser, I can't do that. So perhaps the user expects me to use the read_file tool to get the content, then manually calculate the values. But that's not feasible without knowing the actual data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the CSV is in a format that can be handled by the existing tools. For example, if the CSV is a simple list of numbers, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, the user might have made a mistake in assuming that the tools can handle CSV processing. Since the available tools don't include a CSV parser, I need to inform the user that I can't process the CSV directly. However, the user might be expecting me to use the read_file tool to get the content and then process it. But since I can't execute code, I can't do that. Therefore, I need to explain that I can't process the CSV without a parser.\n\nBut the user's instruction is to create a JSON summary. So maybe the correct approach is to first read the CSV file using the read_file tool, then process the data. However, since I can't process the data, I need to inform the user that I can't perform the calculation without a CSV parser.\n\nWait, but the user might be expecting me to use the read_file tool to get the content, then use the python_execute_code tool to process the data. But the user hasn't provided that tool in their list. Wait, the available tools include python_execute_code. Oh, right! The user has access to the python_execute_code tool. So maybe I can use that to process the CSV data.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Use read_file to get the content of the CSV.\n2. Use python_execute_code to process the CSV data, calculate total customers and average age.\n3"
