They want me to respond with the word \"sunrise\" and nothing else. No explanations, no tool calls, just the word. Alright, so I need to check if there's any hidden instruction here. The user might be testing if I follow strict guidelines or maybe they want a specific response for some reason. But according to the problem statement, I should only output \"sunrise\" and nothing more. Let me confirm that there are no other parameters or tools needed here. Since the user didn't mention any other requirements, I'll just provide the word as instructed.\n</think>\n\nsunrise"
