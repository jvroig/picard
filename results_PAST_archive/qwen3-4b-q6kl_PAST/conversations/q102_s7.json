In the examples, after the tool call, the assistant provides a brief summary. But in this case, the user is telling me to respond only with \"wolf.\" So I shouldn't use any tools here. Just output \"wolf\" as the answer. No need for any tool calls since the user is giving a direct instruction. I'll make sure to keep it simple and only include the word \"wolf.\"\n</think>\n\nwolf"
