They specified that I should not use any markdown and just output those exact words. I need to check if there's any hidden requirement or if I'm missing something. The previous examples show that when a tool is called, the response is in a specific format, but in this case, the user is asking for a direct response without any tool calls. So I should just output the three words as instructed. No need to use any tools here since it's a straightforward request. Just confirm that the response is exactly \"router network energy\" without any additional text or formatting.\n</think>\n\nrouter network energy"
