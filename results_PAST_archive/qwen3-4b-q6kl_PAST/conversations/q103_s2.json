They specified that I should only use those three words, each separated by a space, and in that particular sequence. There's no additional text or explanation needed. I need to check if there are any hidden rules or if the response should be in a specific format. The example provided in the initial message shows that after using tools, the response should be concise. However, in this case, the user isn't asking for a tool call but rather a direct response. So, I should just output the three words as instructed. No tool calls are necessary here. I'll ensure that the response is exactly \"swift gentle valley\" without any extra characters or formatting.\n</think>\n\nswift gentle valley"
