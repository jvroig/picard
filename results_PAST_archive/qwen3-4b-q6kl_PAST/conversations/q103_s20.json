They specified that the response should only be those three words in order. I need to check if there's any additional context or tools required, but the user hasn't mentioned anything else. The previous examples show that when a tool is needed, I should call it and then provide the result. However, in this case, the user isn't asking for a tool call but just a specific response. So I should directly output the three words without any extra text. Let me confirm that there's no hidden instruction here. The user might be testing if I follow strict formatting. Alright, I'll just write \"butterfly workshop outline\" as instructed.\n</think>\n\nbutterfly workshop outline"
