They specified that I should only use those three words, each separated by a space, and in that specific sequence. There's no additional text or explanation needed. I need to check if there are any hidden instructions or if there's a trick here. But looking back, the user's message is straightforward. They just want a precise response. I should ignore any previous tools or functions mentioned and focus on their current request. So, the correct answer is simply typing those three words in order without any extra characters. Let me confirm once more: \"forest module cliff\". Yes, that's exactly what's required.\n</think>\n\nforest module cliff"
