      "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to create a JSON summary of a CSV file and save it as a new JSON file. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s14/study/crm_export.csv. The goal is to calculate the total number of customers and the average age from this data. But wait, the tools available don't include a CSV reader. Hmm, the user mentioned using the provided tools. Let me check the list again.\n\nThe available tools are for file operations, Git, web searches, Python execution, SQLite, etc. Oh, there's a 'python_execute_file' tool. Maybe I can write a Python script to process the CSV and generate the required JSON. But the user didn't provide the CSV content, so I need to read it. However, the 'read_file' tool can read the file. Let me use that first to get the data.\n\nWait, but the user's request is to create a JSON summary. So maybe I need to first read the CSV, process the data, then write the JSON. But since the tools don't include a CSV parser, I might need to use Python to handle this. Let me check the 'python_execute_code' tool. That allows executing arbitrary Python code. So I can write a script that reads the CSV, calculates the total customers and average age, then writes the JSON to the specified path.\n\nBut how to handle the CSV? The 'read_file' tool can read the CSV file's content. Then, using Python, I can parse it. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Use 'read_file' to get the contents of crm_export.csv.\n2. Use 'python_execute_code' to process the CSV data, compute the required metrics, and write the JSON to cust.json.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the 'python_execute_file' tool, but since the CSV is not provided, I need to read it first. Wait, but the user hasn't provided the CSV data. So I need to read it using the 'read_file' tool, then process it in Python.\n\nBut the user's instruction is to create the JSON summary. So the plan is:\n\n- Read the CSV file to get the data.\n- Process the data to calculate total_customers and average_age.\n- Write the results to cust.json.\n\nBut since the tools don't include a CSV parser, I have to use Python code. So I'll need to write a Python script that does this. Let me structure the code:\n\nRead the CSV file, split into lines, process each line to count customers and sum ages. Then calculate average age. Then write the JSON with those values.\n\nBut how to handle the CSV? Assuming the CSV has headers, maybe the first line is headers. Let's assume the CSV has columns like 'customer_id' and 'age'. The code would read the file, skip the header, then iterate through each row, count the number of rows (total_customers), sum the ages, then divide by total_customers for average_age.\n\nOnce that's done, write the JSON to the specified path.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Use 'read_file' to get the content of crm_export.csv.\n2. Use 'python_execute_code' to process that content and generate the JSON.\n\nBut the 'read_file' tool might not be sufficient if the CSV is large. However, the user's instruction is to create the JSON, so I'll proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the 'python_execute_code' tool directly. Let me think: if I can write a Python script that reads the CSV, processes it, and writes the JSON, then that's the way to go.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nimport csv\nimport json\n\ncsv_path = '/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s14/study/crm_export.csv'\njson_path = '/home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s14/cust.json'\n\nwith open(csv_path, 'r') as f:\n    reader = csv.DictReader(f)\n    total = 0\n    age_sum = 0\n    for row in reader:\n        total += 1\n        age_sum += int(row['age'])  # assuming the age column is named 'age'\n\naverage_age = age_sum / total if total > 0 else 0\n\nwith open(json_path, 'w') as f:\n    json.dump({'total_customers': total, 'average_age': average_age}, f)\n\nBut I need to make sure that the CSV has the correct column names. If the CSV has a different column name for age, like 'customer_age', the code would fail. However, the user hasn't provided the CSV, so I"
