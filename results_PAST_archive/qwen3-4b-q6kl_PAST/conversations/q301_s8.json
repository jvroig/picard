Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the CSV file located at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s8/mystery/crm_export.csv. The goal is to calculate the total number of customers and the average age from this data. Then, I have to create another JSON file at /home/jvroig/Dev/sandbox/q301_s8/cust.json with these two values.\n\nBut wait, the tools available don't include a CSV reader. The tools are like read_file, write_file, etc. So maybe I need to use the read_file tool to get the contents of the CSV. Once I have the data, I can process it to find the total customers and average age. However, the user hasn't provided the actual data, so I have to assume that the CSV has the necessary fields.\n\nBut the problem is, the read_file tool can read the file, but processing the data to compute the required metrics would require parsing the CSV. Since I don't have a CSV parser tool, I might need to use the read_file tool to get the data and then manually calculate the values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the read_file tool to get the data, then process it in my mind. But since I can't actually process the data here, perhaps I need to simulate that. Wait, but the user is expecting me to use the tools provided. The tools don't include a CSV parser, so maybe I need to read the file and then compute the values based on the content.\n\nBut without knowing the structure of the CSV, I can't be sure. However, the user is asking for a JSON summary, so I need to make sure that the code I write can handle that. But since the tools don't include a CSV parser, maybe the user expects me to use the read_file tool to get the data and then process it in some way.\n\nWait, the user might be expecting me to use the read_file tool to get the CSV data, then process it to calculate the total customers and average age. But how can I do that without a parser? Maybe the CSV is simple, and I can split the lines and count the rows, but that's not reliable. Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting me to use the read_file tool to get the data and then use some Python code to process it, but the tools don't include a Python executor. Wait, there's a python_execute_code tool. Oh, right! The user can use that.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Use read_file to get the contents of the CSV.\n2. Use python_execute_code to process the CSV data and compute the required metrics.\n3. Use write_file to save the results into the JSON file.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the actual data, so I need to assume that the CSV has columns like 'customer_id' and 'age'. But without knowing the exact structure, I can't be certain. However, the user's instruction is to create the JSON with total_customers and average_age, so I'll proceed under the assumption that the CSV has those fields.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the read_file tool to get the data, then use the python_execute_code tool to process it. Let me outline the steps.\n\nFirst, read the CSV file using read_file. Then, use the python_execute_code tool to process the data. For example, using pandas to read the CSV and compute the metrics. But the user might not have pandas installed, but since the tool is available, maybe it's allowed.\n\nBut the user might not have the necessary libraries. However, the python_execute_code tool can run any Python code, so I can write code to read the CSV and calculate the required values.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the CSV file using read_file.\n2. Use python_execute_code to process the data and compute total_customers and average_age.\n3. Write the results to the JSON file.\n\nBut how to handle the CSV data? Let's think. The read_file tool can read the CSV, but the content is a string. Then, in the Python code, I can split the data into lines and process each line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects that the CSV is in a format where each line represents a customer, and the age is a field. So, for example, the CSV might have headers like 'Name', 'Age', etc. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to code.\n\nBut the user is asking for total_customers and average_age, so the code would need to count the number of rows (excluding header) and sum the ages divided by the count.\n\nSo the Python code would be something like:\n\nimport csv"
